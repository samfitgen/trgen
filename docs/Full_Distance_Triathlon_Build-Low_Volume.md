# Trainer Road Plan: Full Distance Triathlon Build - Low Volume

> In what amounts to as much a battle of will as one of physical capability,
> ultra-distance triathletes have to demonstrate exceedingly high levels of
> fitness & mental fortitude. These Build blocks will address both via longer,
> slightly less intense, but no less challenging workloads.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_   **Ramp Test**  With 12 weeks of base work in your legs, it's time
> to reassess your FTP in order to keep your workouts in line with your
> increasing fitness. Stick with the same workout format (Ramp Test, 8 Minute
> FTP Test or 20 Minute FTP Test) that you used the first time and count this as
> the first strength-endurance workout of your Tri Build training block.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base + Threshold Intervals (2100m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6
> w/ 5s rest between intervals; 2x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 45s rest between
> intervals; 8x25m K drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy,
> RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 15min working up to Easy-Moderate,
> RPE 6 pace to warm up, then insert 3x3-minute Hard, RPE9 high-speed surges
> with 3 minutes of recovery after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down for
> a total of 40 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Kid** In perhaps the kindest manner possible, Kid introduces you
> to the wonderful world of over-unders, a.k.a. lactate tolerance work. These
> little lovelies hold you close to your lactic tipping point at all times -
> sometimes a little over, sometimes a little under, never far from pain. But as
> your muscles and mind learn to tolerate this sort of abuse, both grow in ways
> that few other interval types can inspire.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Base + VO2max + Speed Intervals (2100m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m F &T Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 4x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6
> w/ 5s rest between intervals; 7x75m Hard, RPE9 w/ 45s rest between intervals;
> 7x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between sprints; 8x25m SK drills w/
> 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run + Strides** Run an Easy-Moderate 50 minutes at RPE6 pace
> and include 6x20-second relaxed sprints at RPE10 with 40 seconds of rest after
> each one.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Allegheny** Backing things down a bit from where the Base plan
> left off, your long aerobic endurance ride continues its multi-prong attack on
> taxing your aerobic system in a manner more in line with the actual demands
> faced during your 100+ mile time trial, on familiarizing you with the stresses
> of multiple consecutive hours on the bike (and in your aero position, no
> less), helping you practice your imperative on-the-bike-nutrition and
> hydration, and allowing you to build that vital sense of belief in your
> ability to keep powering your bike for an impressively extended period of
> time.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (3000m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE 4; 2400m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run 2hr10min minutes at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6 pace
> using 1-minute walking breaks when necessary to maintain your form.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> run at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6 pace where you'll get up to race pace quickly.
> OR Olympic-Distance Triathlon

## Week 5

> _Tuesday_ **Mansfield** If working slightly below FTP strengthens the base for
> increases in FTP, working slightly above it serves to actualize those
> increases. Use these short but uncomfortable efforts to grow your boundaries,
> both physically and mentally - grow accustomed to the pain rather than trying
> to avoid it. If possible, spend some time in your aero posture, but on-Target
> power is still the top priority.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base + Threshold Intervals (2600m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m BB Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6
> w/ 5s rest between intervals; 5x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 45s rest between
> intervals; 8x25m K &R; drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy,
> RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Tempo Run** Run 15min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE6 to warm up, then
> run steadily, Moderate-Hard, RPE8 for just 20 minutes before cooling down for
> 10 minutes at an Easy, RPE 4pace for a total of 45 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Bear Creek** Post-recovery-week over-unders - this is gonna hurt
> a bit. With that said, it's the sort of pain you're ready for, both physically
> and mentally. Endure the longer over-segments knowing that a greater training
> stimulus (read: more pain) is often what's necessary to cultivate a stronger,
> more capable athlete. And again, spend as much of the valleys in aero, rise
> when/if necessary, probably during the pushes slightly above FTP.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Base + VO2max + Speed Intervals (2600m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,

> _Friday_ **Base Run + Strides** This week, run an Easy-Moderate 55 minutes at
> RPE6 pace with another mid-run 6x20-second relaxed sprints at RPE10 with 40
> seconds of rest after each.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Makalu** In this, your penultimate long ride (at least for the
> Build phase of training), you'll reach the 3.75-hour mark making this ride
> realistically as taxing and productive as an outdoor ride lasting 5 or 6
> hours.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (3400m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE 4; 2800m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE 4
