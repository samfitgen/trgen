# Trainer Road Plan: Sprint Distance Triathlon - High Volume

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim VO2max + Sprint Intervals (2500m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 6x50m CU Drill; 6x150m Hard, RPE9 w/ 75s rest between intervals; 7x50m
> Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between sprints; 10x25m K Drills w/ 15s
> rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Ramp Test** One final FTP assessment awaits since it's very likely
> you've seen improvement in your highest steady-state power over the course of
> your previous Build conditioning. Stick with your practiced and reliable
> assessment format - Ramp Test, 8 Minute or 20 Minute - and consider today your
> first strength-endurance workout of this new training block.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (3100m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 6x50m F
> &T Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 8x200m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 10s rest
> between intervals; 5x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals;
> Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 20min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 to
> warm up, then repeat 5 Hard, RPE 9, 2-minute near-sprints, recovering running
> at RPE2 for 2 minutes after each; run 20min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down for a
> total of about 60 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Givens** As you adjust to VO2max efforts lasting 3 full minutes
> each, a new objective enters the mix: determining how hard you can work for 3
> minutes at a time and still repeat the effort productively. For some, 110% FTP
> is their max repeatable 3-minute power but for others, efforts all the way up
> at 130% FTP are possible. Find your breaking point, but don't surpass it -
> modify the Workout Intensity accordingly such that you complete each 3-minute
> torture test, barely.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Recovery Run + Strides** Over the course of a 40-minute run at an
> Easy, RPE4 pace, perform 6x20-second relaxed sprints with 40 seconds of
> regular, RPE4 running in between each.
> 
> _Friday_ **Pettit** What is basically your Friday staple workout will now be
> more frequently altered to fit your level of fatigue. When you reach Friday
> with too-heavy legs and low training motivation, do Lazy Mountain instead.
> Reach your Friday fresh and motivated and confident about handling your
> weekend workouts, consider working a little harder using Mont Albert.
> Whichever you choose, head outside if you're getting a bit stale indoors.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Sprint Intervals (2650m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy,
> RPE4; 6x50m F Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/
> 45s rest between intervals; 8x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 10x25m K &R Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
> RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Mount Hayes** For this first week only, we'll pick up your
> strength-endurance work left off. The total volume near your FTP won't change
> much, but the intervals grow in number while getting just a little shorter. So
> if you had a hard time keeping your power on-Target while remaining aero for
> 15 minutes, see if you can do it for 12 at a time.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Tempo Run** Run 10min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE6 to warm up, then
> run steadily, Moderate-Hard, RPE8 for 32 minutes; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to
> cool down for a total of about 52 minutes of running
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2900m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE 4; 2400m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run 70 minutes Easy-Moderate, RPE 6

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> workload. These VO2max repeats are set consistently at 120% FTP, but that

> benefit of Sweet Spot work, less stress and quicker recovery which is vital
> considering tomorrow's brick workout. You have the option of elevating the
> challenge of this workout every other week via the use of Echo +1 or Echo +2,
> but err on the conservative side until you're clear that a more intense ride
> won't sabotage your Friday workout combination.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Recovery Run + Strides** Over the course of another 40-minute run
> at an Easy, RPE4 pace, again perform 6x20-second relaxed sprints with 40
> seconds of regular, RPE4 running in between each.

> 30-minute effort sandwiched within this 45-minute bike workout. Then, you'll
> firm up your transition skills even further before taking off on another
> short10-minute transition run at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6 pace. Don't worry
> about running fast (yet), just try to run well with some heavy fatigue in your
> legs.

> 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Eclipse** With a concern focused more on maintaining your higher-
> level endurance than on a building it much further, these slightly milder
> workouts will keep you strong but allow quicker recovery afterward lending
> themselves to keeping you a bit fresher for the harder more specialized
> training early in each week. Make sure to bank ample time down low.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Tempo Run** Run 10min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE6 to warm up, then
> tack on a couple more minutes of steady, Moderate-Hard, RPE8 for 34 minutes;

> you'll face an assortment of efforts in the VO2max realm that not only vary
> the intensity but trim your usual 1:1 work-rest ratio down to a point where
> your recoveries are a little less generous and more aerobically demanding. All
> of this adds up to more time spent at a high aerobic uptake, less time spent
> drifting away from that high rate of respiration, and in time, greater
> improvements in sustainable power.

> 
> _Thursday_ **Rubicon +2** As your highest priority event(s) draw closer, it's
> time to make things a little more race-specific by spending some time working
> at a realistic if optimistic level of effort. This pace may exceed your
> intended race pace, but the training is valuable nonetheless. Be aero if you
> plan to race at this pace, but sit up as much as you like if this is
> definitely faster than your goal power.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Recovery Run + Strides** Do one more 40-minute run at an Easy,
> RPE4 pace with another 6x20-second relaxed sprints with 40 seconds of regular,
> RPE4 running in between each.
> 
> _Friday_ **Pettit** Again, feel free to alter today's workout to fit your

> 
> _Saturday_ **Galena** To the same end as last Saturday's endurance work, this

> much of these long-duration intervals as you can.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Tempo Run** Run another 10min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE6 to warm,
