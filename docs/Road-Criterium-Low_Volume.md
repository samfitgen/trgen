# Trainer Road Plan: Criterium - Low Volume

> The Criterium plans will prepare you for the highly dynamic nature of crit
> racing by placing heavy emphasis on peaking your high, repeatable power output
> without neglecting your ability to sustain big power for comparably much
> longer durations.
> 
> So whether you're the type of racer who excels via the use of short, explosive
> bouts of work or the type that favors strategic breakaway efforts, a crit plan
> is for you!

## Week 1

> Putting first things first, week 1 begins with an all-important reassessment
> of your FTP via the Ramp Test. You're welcome to follow another assessment
> format if you prefer, as long as it's a reliable and consistent protocol.  
> 
> Your second workout of this first week is a small handful of efforts at a
> realistically high percentage of your newly estimated FTP. The primary
> intention here is to make good use of your intermediate muscle fibers--the
> ones you'll call on frequently over the course of a highly demanding
> criterium.
> 
> Your first week of specialized training then closes with a highly race-
> specific workout format: microbursts. Nothing simulates the on/off demands of
> crit racing quite like sets of short, super-high-intensity efforts coupled
> with extremely low-effort but equally short periods of active recovery. This
> marks the plan's first foray into expanding your anaerobic power capabilities
> while simultaneously elevating your aerobic capacity in a realistic and
> increasingly painful way.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

* **Name**: Nunburnholme
* **Duration**: 1 hour
* **TSS**: 81.0

### Saturday 

* **Name**: Gardiner
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 119.0
* **NP**: 178
* **IF**: 89%

**Description**:

> Gardiner is made up of 4x8-minute sets of increasingly difficult microbursts
> followed by two more 8-minute sets of slightly lower-intensity but no less
> brutal on/off bursts of speed and power.
> 
> All sets consist of 15 seconds at 150-180% FTP followed immediately by 15
> seconds of recovery.
> 
> Recoveries between sets are in the 5 to 6-minute ballpark.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 2

> Week 2 introduces a form of training that's far more intent on raising your
> anaerobic power than other workouts that split their focus between multiple
> training impacts. This workout is one of only a couple workouts devoted solely
> to anaerobic power improvement as later workouts are reasonably bent on making
> your anaerobic power translate to increasingly race-like scenarios.
> 
> Your next workout grows last week's overall demands by a single minute and
> increases the duration of each interval by a single minute as well, all in
> order to keep things manageable but progressively more challenging. This is
> the very nature of chasing training adaptation and one you're probably quite
> familiar with by now.
> 
> This week closes with a highly specialized interval format that you've likely
> faced as part of the Short Power Build plan. Emulating the nature of criterium
> racing where you're either fully pinned or working _just hard enough to stay
> with the pack/just easy enough to keep from passing out_ , the recoveries
> between these very short, very intense intervals only fall to Sweet Spot watts
> as opposed to the usual recovery effort level.

**Description**:

> This pyramid-format VO2max workout grows the number of 15/15's (125% FTP/88%

> repeats.
> 
> Occasional 88% FTP floats last as long as 30 seconds and recoveries between
> each set lasts roughly as long as the set preceding it.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 3

> The second of your two Anaerobic workouts trims the recoveries down a bit, but
> make no mistake, this workout still emphasizes force over conditioning. These
> descending intervals (time descends, power rises) offer equal-time recovery
> keeping the anaerobic vs aerobic balance a little heavier on the anaerobic
> side. The nearly as important secondary aim is to bring you closer to the
> demands of races where the importance of high-power _repetition_ far outweighs
> the possibility of a 30-second power PR.
> 
> Your varied VO2max-ish repeats actually decline in overall workload this time
> around, but the addition of yet another minute per interval will prevent them
> from feeling accommodating, nowhere near easy. But the difference in hitting
> it hard for 6 minutes compared to a hard 4 or even 5-minutes is often the
> difference between winning and falling out of the top 20. Possible results
> aside, the shock to your aerobically driven system can't help but yield
> greater race capabilities; again, **given adequate and proper recovery**.
> 
> Finally, you'll close your third week of specialized loading and refinement
> with a mildly harsher set of high-amplitude VO2max repeats where recovery
> comes after a  _series  _of VO2max efforts rather than between each of them.

## Week 4

> Time to let some of your event-specific training (not to mention any yet-to-
> materialize Build training adaptation) soak in over the course of an easy
> weekâ€™s training. Over the span of this week, remind yourself frequently and
> loudly that  **adaptation happens during recovery** , not during the sometimes
> undeniably damaging doses of training that comprise much of your loading
> weeks.
> 
> If you haven't yet learned the benefit of proper and adequate recovery, some
> hard lessons await you on the racecourse. If, however, you recognize the
> benefit of recovery done correctly, continue to treat your downtime with due
> respect as you work toward the peak fitness that lies just ahead.

Rest Day

## Week 5

> Time to get back to work and hone each of your vital race capabilities to
> near-perfection while realizing some final, subtle improvements in overall
> fitness beginning with a series of VO2max intervals disguised as short but
> sweet race scenarios. The intensity here is high, but also very much in line
> with what you're likely to face in your next crit race.
> 
> As if these short/short repeats weren't race-specific or difficult enough
> already, the next evolution incorporates a _hard-start_ effort that will
> exploit the high-power  capabilities you've refined over the first half of
> this Specialty training plan. Master this format and accelerating off the
> line, into a prime sprint, or across a gap will now pave the way for a hard
> round of efforts instead of a cop-out recovery.
> 
> This fifth week closes out with the first of two rigorous race simulations
> that are sure to be at least as demanding, if not more so, than your peak
> event(s). With a lap format based on a local-ish and highly esteemed NCNCA
> crit course, these repeats will challenge even the toughest, most race-ready
> crit racers and make you tougher and faster in the process.

> 
> Each lap has two short but punishing back-to-back, segmented climbs.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 6

> Your final pre-taper week of training begins with another round of intervals
> that are half composed of Threshold repeats and half made of VO2max efforts,
> mashed together with no downtime in between. These escalating demands will
> draw on every form of fitness you've developed up to this point and very
> likely shine a light on just how capable and versatile a rider you've become.  
>   
> Then, your second workout of the week is nearly a repeat of last week's hard-
> start, short/short intervals with a mild bump in the intensity of that initial
> jump. If you can open a good gap with 30 seconds at 150%, what might you do
> with a 165% pounce? Only one way to find out.  
>   
> Then, to wrap up your final full-volume week, the grisly but reasonably true
> to reality Tour de Nez race simulation awaits. While the meat of this workout
> is slightly lower than that of last week's, the minor but somehow _not_
> inconsequential increase in intensity will even things out, and then some.
