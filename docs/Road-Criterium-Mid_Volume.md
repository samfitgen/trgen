# Trainer Road Plan: Criterium - Mid Volume

> The Criterium plans will prepare you for the highly dynamic nature of crit
> racing by placing heavy emphasis on peaking your high, repeatable power output
> without neglecting your ability to sustain big power for comparably longer
> durations.
> 
> Whether you're the type of racer who excels via the use of short, explosive
> bouts of work or the type that favors strategic breakaway efforts, the crit
> plan is for you!

## Week 1

> Putting first things first, week 1 begins with an all-important reassessment
> of your FTP via the Ramp Test. You're welcome to follow another assessment
> format if you prefer, as long as it's a reliable and consistent protocol.
> 
> Following a slightly longer than usual aerobic spin, your second interval
> workout of this first week is a small handful of efforts at a realistically
> high percentage of your newly estimated FTP. The primary intention here is to
> make good use of your intermediate muscle fibers--the ones you'll call on
> frequently over the course of a highly demanding criterium.
> 
> Your first weekend of specialized training then begins with a highly
> specialized interval format you've likely faced as part of the Short Power
> Build plan. Emulating the nature of criterium racing where you're either fully
> pinned or working  _just hard enough to stay with the pack/just easy enough to
> keep from passing out_ , the recoveries between these very short, intense
> intervals fall to Sweet Spot watts as opposed to the usual recovery effort
> level.
> 
> Week 1 then closes with a bit of focus on elevating both your ability to
> generate extremely high power for a substantial duration - 30 brutal but
> potentially very impactful seconds - and then shifts focus to lifting your
> ability to sustain a high percentage of your FTP immediately afterward. By
> coupling high-force work with muscle endurance efforts, each of these
> intervals serves as its own breakaway simulation while reinforcing two
> important components of aggressive criterium racing.  
> 
> If you'd rather ride longer but at a lighter level of intensity, consider
> Conness or Springer Mountain. Alternatively, head outdoors for an Endurance
> ride between 60-70% FTP, with a handful of sprints thrown in, and work to
> accumulate roughly the same TSS as the scheduled workout.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> remaining 14 minutes.
> 
> Each interval is separated by 3 minutes of recovery.

## Week 2

> Week 2 introduces a form of training that's far more intent on raising your
> anaerobic power than other workouts that split their focus between multiple
> training impacts. This workout is one of a handful of workouts devoted solely
> to anaerobic power improvement as later workouts are reasonably bent on making
> your anaerobic power translate to increasingly race-like scenarios.
> 
> Following a short Endurance ride aimed at active recovery as well as aerobic
> maintenance, your next workout grows last week's demands by two minutes and
> marginally longer intervals in order to keep things manageable but
> progressively more challenging. This is the very nature of chasing training
> adaptation and one you're probably quite familiar with it by now.
> 
> The weekend begins with another iteration of last week's short/short efforts,
> but this time follows a "pyramid" structure where the duration of each
> interval rises to a peak and then descends back down to a repeat of the
> shorter intervals that kicked off the workout in order to keep things mildly
> more interesting and productively varied.
> 
> The weekend then closes with a near repeat of last week's hard-start strength-
> endurance intervals where the post-jump Sweet Spot intensity rises slightly
> and tasks you with sustaining a slightly higher percentage of your FTP for a
> quarter hour at a time. Feel free to go the longer/slower route with Boarstone
> +2, the even longer/even slower Laurentian, or head outdoors and log some
> Endurance mileage while you accumulate a couple minutes of sprinting.

> Torbert is made up of 4x15-minute race-start intervals that each begin with a
> 30-second surge at 150% FTP and then quickly settles in at 90% FTP for the
> remaining 14 minutes.
> 
> Each interval is separated by 3 minutes of recovery.

## Week 3

> The second of your four Anaerobic workouts trims the recoveries down a bit,
> but make no mistake, this workout still emphasizes force over conditioning.
> These descending intervals (time descends, power rises) offer equal-time
> recovery keeping the anaerobic vs aerobic balance a little heavier on the
> anaerobic side. The nearly as important secondary aim is to bring you closer
> to the demands of races where the importance of high-power  _repetition  _far
> outweighs the possibility of a 30-second power PR.
> 
> Spin off some of the heaviness inflicted from your anaerobic endeavors, and
> then your varied VO2max-ish repeats maintain the very same workload as last
> week but with the addition of yet another minute per interval aiming to
> increase your high-power aptitude even more. The difference in hitting it hard
> for 6 minutes compared to a hard 4 or even 5 minutes is often the difference
> between winning and falling out of the top 20. Possible results aside, the
> shock to your aerobically driven system can't help but yield greater race
> capabilities; again,  **given adequate and proper recovery**.
> 
> This third weekend begins with another pyramid-format round of short/short
> intervals with those same unforgivingly high recovery valleys, but this time
> the workload is more densely packed and therefore more in line with the
> relentless demands of crit racing.
> 
> You'll close your third week of specialized loading and refinement with a
> mildly more demanding set of stomp and sustain intervals that now lift the
> 15-minute sustained-power stretches all the way up to a point where they
> nearly hug your FTP. Learn to endure indoor efforts like these and you'll
> cultivate the outdoor ability to dish out flyer after flyer until one of them
> sticks.
> 
> Feel free to simulate this workout outdoors too, or tone things down indoors
> and ride either Big Squaw or Ptarmigan or ideally Hesperus since it includes a
> handful of sprints.

## Week 4

> Time to let some of your event-specific training (not to mention any yet-to-

> week’s training. Over the span of this week, remind yourself frequently and
> loudly that  **adaptation happens during recovery** , not during the damaging

## Week 5

> Time to get back to work and hone each of your vital race capabilities to
> near-perfection while realizing some final, subtle improvements in overall
> fitness beginning with a familiar round of Anaerobic repeats similar to week
> 2's short-power efforts. Based on what you may have learned there, feel
> encouraged to make each of these relatively quick durations as productive as
> possible by tweaking the workout intensity such that you barely complete each
> painful effort.
> 
> Noodle away some of the ensured muscle heaviness the next day before moving
> onto your first round of shrinking-recovery, short/short Anaerobic power
> repeats where this week's 50-second recovery valleys only get shorter as you
> grow your ability to do real work without real rest.
> 
> This fifth weekend begins with the first of two rigorous race simulations that
> are sure to be at least as demanding, if not more so, than your peak event(s).
> With a lap format based on a local-ish and highly esteemed NCNCA crit course,
> these repeats will challenge even the toughest, most race-ready crit racers
> and make you tougher and faster in the process.
> 
> Should you have any gas left in your tank come Sunday, log some time in the
> Sweet Spot and keep that muscle endurance on the upswing. And in the event
> you'd rather ride longer but easier, try Boarstone or Koip or head outdoors
> for a similar-TSS ride in the 60-70% FTP ballpark.

## Week 6

> Your final pre-taper week of training begins with your last Anaerobic power
> workout and what promises to push even the most anaerobically adept riders
> right to the brink over the course of these high power sets. The recoveries
> are relatively lengthy, but it's likely the one power-duration combination
> will be tougher than the others; this is where you dig the deepest and achieve
> a new level of performance.
> 
> Ride off some of the dead-legs lethargy the next day and then it's onto a
> mildly harsher version of last week's short/short affair. This week, the
> already too-short recovery valleys shrink a bit further thus keeping your
> aerobic uptake elevated for more of each set as its burden (and eventual
> training benefit) only rises, rises, rises.
> 
> Your final full-volume weekend commences beginning with the grisly but
> reasonably true to reality Tour de Nez race simulation. While the meat of this
> workout is slightly lower than that of last week's, the minor increase in
> intensity will even things out, and then some.
> 
> If your legs are still up for a bit of work, a quartet of Sweet Spot repeats
> awaits. Should you decide to shift the focus from muscular endurance to
> aerobic endurance, substitute Virginia +2 for a sizable drop in intensity or
> even Koip if you'd like to tone things down even more. And as always, outdoor
> rides can be a welcome alternative to indoor training, and these simpler-
> structure rides lend themselves well to working in a less controlled
> environment.

> race performance, and this final week should do just that.
> 
> Saturday is an  _openers_  workout based on a Sunday crit, but if your race
