# Trainer Road Plan: General Build - High Volume

## Week 1

> First things first: time to assess improvement born out of your recent Base
> training plans allowing you to adjust your FTP, and with it, all of the power
> levels anchored to it. While the Ramp Test is scheduled, you're welcome to use
> the 20 Minute FTP Test or the 8 Minute FTP Test and utilize whichever format
> you prefer.
> 
> Up next, an atypically long aerobic Endurance ride containing a handful of
> mid-workout sprints makes up some of the TSS missed during your assessment
> workout. Then, you'll face a round of slightly-suprathreshold intervals where
> the aim is to lift your FTP by exposing you to watts only slightly above it.
> This workout concludes with one long stretch of aerobic Endurance riding that
> helps keep tomorrow's Endurance ride a little more manageable.
> 
> This easy Friday ride is aimed at helping you bounce back from your weekday
> interval workouts, and then your weekend begins with a demanding set of over-
> unders that emphasize the over-segments and hold you above your FTP for a
> couple minutes at a time, numerous times over.
> 
> Your first week of training closes out with some rather lengthy, no-frills
> Sweet Spot repeats bent on lifting your sustained power capabilities in a
> gentler manner than less forgiving Threshold repeats. But if you want things
> even gentler (but longer), replace Round Bald with Big Squaw or use Hesperus
> if you'd like to include a few early-ride sprints.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> Week 2 kicks off with three challenging rounds of VO2max work done way up at
> 120% FTP. If 3-minute repeats at this intensity turn this workout into a near
> impossibility, dial the intensity down a few percentage points and find a
> highly challenging but repeatable 3-minute power. Then settle in for a
> straight block of aerobic Endurance riding on tired but still capable muscles
> as you fatigue a wide range of muscle fiber types in your quest to fully tax
> your aerobic system.
> 
> Then it's on to a short and mild aerobic Endurance ride containing a small
> handful of sprints aimed at keeping your jump powerful while still allowing
> your legs a bit of very active recovery.
> 
> Then you'll face a slightly bulkier round of repeats done just above your FTP
> since riding just above your FTP is one of the best ways to raise it as long
> as you don't overdo it. Which is why this workout is followed by something
> short and light to rest you up a bit before your weekend workouts are upon
> you.
> 
> Up first, you'll face a marginally more demanding set of over-under intervals
> aimed at thoroughly challenging, and eventually growing, your ability to hold
> high percentages of your FTP for longer and longer durations.
> 
> Then your weekend finishes off with a straightforward round of Sweet Spot
> repeats to further solidify your strength endurance capabilities. Should you
> want to go a bit easier for longer, skip Spruce Knob in favor of Town Hill or
> Flattop if you want a few sprints thrown in.

> between intervals.

## Week 3

> Week 3's VO2max intervals won't see a big change in TSS, but they'll exert a
> noticeably different stress on your aerobic system, muscles and probably your
> head since the duration jumps up to some long, 5-minute repeats. If the 5%
> reduction over last week's intensity isn't enough to keep you hanging in there
> for durations this long, trim it down a bit and work through as much of these
> longer efforts as possible, even if that means the occasional 10-second
> backpedal break.
> 
> Pedal through your midweek aerobic/sprints ride and then it's time for your
> last dose of 102's where you'll inch up the total time spent a little above
> FTP by a couple more minutes and continue to grow your ability to hold supra-
> FTP watts while also setting the stage for later increases in your threshold
> power.
> 
> Following an easy Friday spin, the weekend starts with the last set of over-
> under intervals this plan has to offer. This workout in particular is about as
> challenging as 90 minutes can get, but you can reduce that intensity a little
> bit by extending the recovery valleys by a few minutes and heading into each
> 12-minute round of work a little more refreshed, perhaps a bit more motivated
> and able to resist the temptation to stop pedaling after each 2-minute over-
> segment.
> 
> Finally, it's simply a matter of enduring some long (but not as long as last
> week's) Sweet Spot intervals with generously long recovery valleys between
> them. If you'd like to go longer and a slower, scrap Tray Mountain and have a
> go at Maclure or Tenaya or head outside and rack up the prescribed TSS with
> some low-intensity mileage.

## Week 5

> It's highly likely your fitness has improved over the course of the first 4
> weeks of your Build conditioning. So you'll want to adjust your training zones
> accordingly and keep the challenges climbing right along with your
> capabilities. Accordingly, Week 5 begins with another Ramp Test assessment
> workout, one you're welcome to swap for either the 20 Minute FTP Test or the 8
> Minute FTP Test if you prefer.
> 
> Then it's on to another temporarily lengthened Endurance/Sprint workout before
> moving on to a different form of VO2max work in the form of some short-short
> repeats where you'll repeat high-intensity efforts for a minute and rest
> briefly before doing it again and again. This form of training is beneficial
> on the high-end power end of things but it also emphasizes repeatability while
> thoroughly challenging your aerobic system's ability to manage the anaerobic
> byproduct accumulation.
> 
> Like Wednesday, Friday's Endurance ride is a bit longer than usual in order to
> make up for your relatively low-TSS assessment workout, but the intensity is
> low and there are no sprints to disrupt the easy nature of this fat-burning
> ride.
> 
> Then your weekend begins with what might be your first exposure to microbursts
> via a few rounds of punchy efforts that address your neuromuscular and
> anaerobic power capabilities as well as your aerobic system's ability to
> support your attempts at repeating them over and over.
> 
> Wrap things up with another round of Sweet Spot repeats, ones that force you
> to employ an intermediate recovery such that you recognize the upside of
> keeping your legs only slightly fresher over the course of longer intervals.
> Again, go the longer/slower route by skipping Juneau in favor of something
> like Town Hill or Boarstone +3.

## Week 6

> Week 6 kicks off by splitting the duration difference between week 2's
> 3-minute VO2max repeats and week 3's 5-minute jobbers and lands you right in
> the middle with a couple rounds of 4-minute, max-aerobic efforts. Use your

> Intensity in order to last the full duration of most, if not all, of these
> mid-duration, high-intensity repeats.
> 
> The you'll briefly square off against a short aerobic ride and only a couple
> of late-workout sprints before moving on to a very similar but slightly more
> challenging trio of short-short interval sets where the work durations grow a
> little but the recovery durations remain unfairly short, all in the interest

> strength endurance work, several times over, before capping each set with one
> final kick thereby addressing all of the energy systems necessary during a
> race-winning move.
> 
> The weekend and week 6 finish out with some longer Sweet Spot intervals
> separated by some shorter recovery valleys, both modifications aimed at
> furthering the challenge placed on your ever-growing strength endurance
> capabilities. Feel free to skip the Sweet Spot work in favor of some lighter &
> longer aerobic Endurance riding via Big Mountain or try Tenaya if you're

**Description**:

> Pettit is an hour of Aerobic Endurance spent mostly between 60-70% FTP and
> includes Form Sprints, Endurance Spinning intervals, and Pistons/Kick and Pull
> pedaling drills.
> 
> Form Sprints: Practice high-rpm sprint simulations at low power outputs to
> reinforce proper sprinting technique by jumping out-of-the-saddle and winding
> up a light gear. As your cadence reaches its controllable peak, gracefully
> transition into the saddle where you can shift gears if necessary. These
> sprints are only 10s long and are all about leg speed, form, and technique.
> Experiment with which foot to lead with, and learn how to generate a lot of
> leg speed in very little time.
> 
> Endurance Spinning: Practice spinning slightly quicker than your natural,
> self-selected cadence. Ride at a cadence that's at the very top of your
> comfortable rpm range and remain there for a solid 5 minutes. The goal is to
> learn to turn the pedals more quickly with less force (muscle stress) thereby
> improving your ability to remain predominantly aerobic over a wide range of
> rpm's. If your HR rises more than a few BPM, you're pedaling too quickly -
> take it easy and stay relaxed but quick.
> 
> Pistons: Few if any riders need to practice pushing down on the pedals, but
> improvements in how well your knees move are both beneficial to economy and
> joint health. As you pedal, pay close attention to how your knees track. They
> should move directly up, directly down - like pistons - with little if any
> lateral movement, especially at the top of each pedalstroke. Focus on one knee
> for 30s before switching sides.
> 
> Kick and Pull: A balanced pedalstroke is dependent upon consistent tension on
> your bike's drivetrain throughout the entire pedalstroke. Reinforce your
> ability to maintain tension through the weakest portions of the pedalstroke,
> the top and bottom quadrants. As your knee approaches top-dead-center, lightly
> kick your toes into the fronts of your shoes, and as your feet approach
> bottom-dead-center, lightly pull your heels into the backs of your shoes -
> kick and pull. Focus on just the kick for 30s, just the pull for 30s, then
> eventually both for 30s simultaneously.
> 
> Modifications: 2 late-ride sprints

> Noodle through a short, end-of-week ride and mentally brace yourself for your
> final weekend of workouts before wrapping up this General Build phase.

> The weekend in question begins with a fun if painful combination of sprints
> and barely suprathreshold repeats bent on furthering both your ability to ride
> explosively as well as sustain power a little above your FTP.
> 
> Last but not least, you'll face your longest round of Sweet Spot intervals
> yet, at least in terms of total time in the Sweet Spot. And as usual, you're
> welcome to go the longer, slower route either indoors or out. Should you stay
> inside, check out Mount Cook or Allegheny.

## Week 8

> Having made it through 7 demanding weeks of General Build conditioning, it's
> again time to rest up with a near repeat of Week 4's recovery cycle.
> 
> And by repeating your recovery weeks in very similar fashion, you're provided
> with an opportunity to modify your recovery workloads to fit your particular
> recovery profile. Did your last recovery week leave you feeling a bit too
> tired to dive back into training? Perhaps you didn't need quite as much rest
> as you were given.
> 
> Whatever the case, highly similar recovery weeks provide a consistent protocol
> that can be altered as necessary such that you feel eager and rested heading
> into your next round of training without feeling like you backed off too far.

### Saturday 

* **Name**: Hatch
* **Duration**: 2 hours
* **TSS**: 83.0
* **NP**: 128
* **IF**: 64%

**Description**:

> Hatch is nearly 2 hours of Aerobic Endurance spent between 60-70% FTP.
> 
> Hatch also includes an early set of 3 Power Sprints.
> 
> Hatch's form drills include Endurance Spinning intervals and some Single-Leg
> Focus drills.
> 
> Power Sprints: These are the culmination of Form Sprints and Strength Sprints
> and teach you to overcome heavy resistance quickly.
> 
> At a reasonable cadence, 85-95rpm, jump out-of-the-saddle and wind up a
> reasonably big gear (not as big as the gear used during Strength Sprints).
> 
> These sprints are only 10s long and should allow you to get in a maximum of 24
> pedal revolutions and reach a high rpm, 130rpm or higher.
> 
> Practice winding up a lot of watts in the briefest time possible while
> maintaining the form and technique you picked up during previous Form Sprints.
> 
> Experiment with which foot to lead with, and don't hesitate to practice
> leading with either.
> 
> Endurance Spinning: Practice spinning slightly quicker than your natural,
> self-selected cadence.
> 
> Ride at a cadence that's at the very top of your comfortable rpm range and
> remain there for a solid 5 minutes.
> 
> The goal is to learn to turn the pedals more quickly with less force (muscle
> stress) thereby improving your ability to remain predominantly aerobic over a
> wide range of rpm's.
> 
> If your HR rises more than a few bpm, you're pedaling too quickly - take it
> easy and stay relaxed but quick.
> 
> Single-Leg Focus: The objective here is to learn to more effectively apply
> power through the entire pedalstroke by focusing strictly on one leg's
> activity through the bottom, upstroke, and over the top of the pedalstroke.
> 
> For 90 seconds at a time, devote your attention to one leg before switching to
> the other. Your cadence may fall slightly, but these drills typically come
> more naturally to less experienced "one-leggers".
> 
> Pay particular attention to lightly pulling your foot across the bottom,
> lifting your knee lightly upward and then softly kicking over the top of each
> pedalstroke.
> 
> Add this drill indoors or outdoors as often as you like, more frequently if
> you recognize a substantial difference in one leg's strength or coordination.
