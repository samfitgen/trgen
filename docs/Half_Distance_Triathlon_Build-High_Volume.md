# Trainer Road Plan: Half Distance Triathlon Build - High Volume

> Having established your fairly broad base of fitness, these Build blocks shift
> your training emphasis slightly away from intensity and more toward moderate-
> level suffering. The importance of tolerating this longer-term physiological &
> psychological challenge without succumbing to the urge to ease up is now your
> primary focus.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max + Speed Intervals (2750m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy,
> RPE4; 12x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6
> w/ 5s rest between intervals; 8x75m Hard, RPE9 w/ 45s rest between intervals;
> 6x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between sprints; 12x25m K drills w/
> 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 400m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_   **Ramp Test**  With 8 weeks of base work in your legs, it's time
> to reassess your FTP in order to keep your workouts in line with your
> increasing fitness. Stick with the same workout format (Ramp Test, 8 Minute
> FTP Test or 20 Minute FTP Test) that you used the first time and count this as
> the first strength-endurance workout of your Tri Build training block.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2800m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 6x50m F
> &T Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x200m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 10s rest
> between intervals; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals;
> Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Tempo Run** Run 10min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE6 to warm up, then
> run steadily, Moderate-Hard, RPE8 for 25 minutes; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to
> cool down for a total of 45 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Sweet Spot Ride + Base Run (Brick)** This midweek brick consists
> of a 75-minute bike workout where you'll sustain 60 minutes of effort between
> 80-85% FTP before dismounting and transitioning quickly into your running gear
> and doing a short20-minute run at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6 pace to increase your
> familiarity with running well straight off the bike.
> 
> _Friday_ **Pettit** Take it easy on the bike today while staying active but
> keeping recovery at the forefront of your mind.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Speed Intervals (2700m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4;
> 12x25m F drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 45s
> rest between intervals; 6x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 12x25m K &R drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 400m easy,
> RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Appalachian** Picking up where the Base plan left off, your long
> aerobic endurance ride advances its multi-prong attack on taxing your aerobic
> system in a manner more in line with the actual demands faced during your
> 56-mile time trial, on familiarizing you with the stresses of multiple
> consecutive hours on the bike (and in your aero position, no less), helping
> you practice your imperative on-the-bike-nutrition and hydration, and allowing
> you to build that vital sense of belief in your ability to keep powering your
> bike for an impressively extended period of time.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Run Speed Intervals** Run 15min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 to
> warm up, then perform 7x1-minute, All-Out, high-speed efforts, RPE10 with 3
> minutes of recovery running, RPE4 between each; cool down for 10 Easy minutes,
> RPE4 for about 55 minutes of running
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2300m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE 4; 2000m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run 1hr40min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 with as few, if
> any, walking breaks.

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> rest between intervals; 7x75m Hard, RPE9 w/ 45s rest between intervals; Cool-
> Down 400m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Spencer** Only a total of 15 minutes of VO2max work this week, and
> it comes in a relatively friendly format since the concern is more about
> maintaining fitness and absorbing improvements. The intensity is set at 120%
> but you can reduce these as far down as 110% and still maintain the workout's
> objectives pretty well. So if your fatigue is high and you know it, err on the
> side of caution and trim the intensity a bit today.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2400m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 6x50m F
> &T; Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x200m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 10s rest
> between intervals; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

> drop back down to a steady, Moderate-Hard, RPE8 for 25 minutes this week; run
> 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down for a total of 45 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Avalanche Spire** Still going to see some over-unders this week,
> but in an effort to make your recovery real and useful, your above-FTP pushes
> are shorter-lived ramps and the intervals are a scant 6 minutes each. If you
> haven't already, try spending the valleys in your aero position, then sit
> upright during the ramps if necessary.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Run Speed Intervals** Run 15min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 to
> warm up, then this week just toss in 6x1-minute, All-Out, high speed efforts,
> RPE10 with 3 minutes of recovery running, RPE4 between each; cool down for 10
> Easy minutes, RPE4 for about 50 minutes of running
> 
> _Friday_ **Pettit** Being a recovery week, feel free to shorten or even skip
> this easy ride if your level of fatigue won't allow you to make low watts feel
> very manageable.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Speed Intervals (2200m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4;
> 12x25m FS drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 45s

> sprints; Cool-Down 400m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **If racing tomorrow, just ride an easy hour; otherwise, do a Sweet
> Spot Ride + Tempo Run (Brick)** This midweek brick consists of a 75-minute
> bike workout where you'll sustain 60 minutes of effort between 80-85% FTP
> before dismounting and transitioning quickly into your running gear and doing
> a reasonably short30-minute run at a Moderate-Hard, RPE8 pace which simulates
> an aggressively fast but possibly realistic race pace.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2000m) OR Sprint Distance Triathlon** Either
> warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 1500m Easy-Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4
> OR compete in a B-priority practice race.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** Run 70min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 this week if you didn't
> race today.
