# Trainer Road Plan: Half Distance Triathlon - Low Volume

> The low-volume version of the Half Distance Triathlon specialty block was
> designed with the first-time half distance triathlete in mind, or really for
> any triathlete who wishes to prepare for an event of this magnitude with only
> a handful of training hours available each week. We recognize that completing
> a 1.2 mile open water swim, a 56-mile bike leg and then running 13.1 miles is
> a tall order for any athlete, but doing it with relatively few weekly training
> hours requires a plan devoid of wasted time.
> 
> So this race-specific, time-constrained block will make efficient use of
> limited weekly workouts where you’re typically swimming, riding & running 3
> times each week, for 8 weeks.
> 
> Every other week, you’ll face a brick (ride/run) workout where you’ll practice
> running directly off the bike, and the fourth week includes the option of a
> tune-up, Olympic distance triathlon in place of the scheduled brick workout.
> 
> Then weeks 7 & 8 are devoted to tapering your training just in time for your
> event which ideally falls at the end of the eighth & final week.
> 
> In total, you’ll be on the bike between 4-6 hours each week with a slight
> reduction in training time during the final 2 taper weeks.
> 
> Please understand that this schedule is flexible and should be tailored to fit
> your non-training schedule and personal recovery habits. And while we include
> recommendations on where to place your run & swim workouts, their composition
> is up to you.
> 
> This is the right plan for you if your goal is simply the successful
> completion of a half-distance triathlon.

## Week 1

> As Monday is typically a weekly rest day, week 1 begins with a round of Sweet
> Spot repeats on Tuesday that aim to increase your muscle endurance, lengthen
> your time to exhaustion and raise your long-distance power output. But if you
> feel there’s been a measurable improvement in your FTP and you prefer to
> assess that improvement in order to establish new training zones, substitute
> the 20 Minute Test in place of Carson.
> 
> Wednesday is a good time for a morning swim workout and an afternoon run, and
> then Thursday will having you logging a steady 60 minutes of effort very close
> to what will probably be your race day power output.
> 
> Friday should include a morning swim workout as well as an afternoon run
> workout, and then Saturday exposes you to your first long indoor endurance
> ride. Should you choose to do this ride outdoors, pad the duration to account
> for outdoor training disruptions. Depending on how frequently your steady
> riding is interrupted, up-adjust your training time by .3x to .5x. For
> example, a 2.5 hour ride could last as long as 3.5-4.0 hours depending on the
> level of disruptions. And it’s extremely important that you’re spending the
> far majority of your time riding in your aero position, indoors or out.
> 
> Close your week with your long swim early on Sunday followed by your longest
> run later that day.

> pace ride.
> 
> Following Friday’s morning swim and afternoon run, Saturday brings with it the
> first of several brick workouts. In this one, you’ll ride a little over an
> hour, in your aero position, at an intensity probably a little below the one
> you’ll utilize on race day before hopping off the bike, transitioning into
> your running gear, and running for a half hour at a pace a little below the
> pace you’ll target during your half marathon. Use a quick running cadence for
> the first mile or two and learn to work through that heavy-leg discomfort.
> 
> Finally, your week is again capped off with your longest weekly swim followed
> later in the day by your longest run of the week.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 4

> Week 4 is about two things: absorbing the stress of your previous training and
> building your fitness and confidence with an Olympic distance triathlon (or a
> close simulation).
> 
> Since your training is of the low-volume, minimal nature, your Tuesday workout
> won’t differ greatly from the previous weeks and only drops the overall work
> volume slightly.
> 
> Wednesday is still a swim/run combination that’s best done at shorter
> durations but with similar intensity as previous weeks, and then Thursday will
> only ask you to ride for an hour at the same intensity you’ve been utilizing
> for slightly longer durations in previous weeks.
> 
> Following Friday’s lighter swim and run workouts, Saturday will differ
> depending on your weekend’s options: race or race simulation.
> 
> If you plan to race on Sunday, keep Saturday short and easy with a low-
> intensity, 30-minute ride like Taku, then put all your training into action
> come Sunday.
> 
> If, on the other hand, you’re planning to simulate your race, kick things off
> with a 15-minute swim prior to a brick workout consisting of a 45-minute ride
> followed immediately by a 30-minute run, both near race pace. Do your best to
> move directly from the swim to the brick workout and keep this as close to the
> demands of your upcoming race as possible by rolling from one event to the
> next with smooth, relaxed and quick transitions. Then on Sunday, get in a
> short swim and a short run later in the day.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 5

> Time to get back at it, but if you competed in an Olympic distance tri last
> weekend then you might need an extra day of rest this week - listen to your
> body. If that’s not the case though, get right back on track with a bit of a
> bump up in intensity as you repeat efforts very close to your highest
> sustainable power, i.e. your FTP. The aim here is to further your muscle
> endurance and make the work done at race pace more tolerable and even a little
> quicker than it is right now.
> 
> Following Wednesday’s swim/run routine, you’ll face over an hour’s worth of
> riding at race pace in order to increase your time ability to stay powerful
> and aero without dipping too deeply into your sugar stores.
> 
> Make the most of your Friday swim and run combo and then move on to Saturday’s
> longest endurance ride yet. Whether you choose to do this one indoors or
> outdoors, don’t hesitate to push the duration up to match your anticipated
> bike split. In other words, if you expect a 3.5-hour bike split on race day,
> you’re welcome to work in a 3.5-hour ride today as long as the extra duration
> doesn’t progress this ride’s stress too high too quickly - be sensible.
> 
> Finally, wrap up week 5 with with your long swim and run of the week and earn
> that Monday rest day.

Rest Day

## Week 6

> One more week before you start to taper and shed some fatigue, but not before
> you get through this beast of a week which kicks off with your most demanding
> muscle endurance workout of the training block.
> 
> Work your way up and down 4 sets of power ladders and gain an appreciation for
> what it’s like to push up a hill or pass another rider without fading, and in
> the process, build a little more leg strength.
> 
> Following your Wednesday swim and run workouts, Thursday brings one more
> opportunity to decide if your targeted race power is realistic. Get through
> this one and then honestly assess whether or not you could hold that power for
> roughly twice that length of time.
> 
> Make the most of your Friday swim/run combination keeping in mind that your
> weekend revolves around your penultimate brick workout.
> 
> This particular brick will bring you as close to your race durations and
> intensities as you’re going to get during this final training block, so treat
> it as though it’s the real thing and that includes a pre-brick swim. You’ll
> hold race pace for a solid 90 minutes and then transition directly to your
> race-pace run for 40-50 minutes afterward.
> 
> This week’s done and dusted once you get in a long swim on Sunday but instead
> of your long run this week, weave a little bit of race intensity into a
> shorter run.

> bringing your workout durations down even lower than last week’s while, you
> guessed it, keeping every bit of the intensity starting with a shorter version
> of last week’s Sweet Spot workout.
> 
> After a short but no less intense set of swim and run workouts on Wednesday,
> Thursday offers a relatively short but confidence-boosting, jitters-
> demolishing race rehearsal in the form of your final brick workout where
> you’ll ride at race pace for an hour and then zing through a quick transition
> run lasting between 20-30 minutes consisting of race-pace (or even slightly
> above race-pace) running.
> 
> Friday is nothing more than a short, fast swim workout while Saturday is
> reserved for a reduced-duration version of last week’s race openers workout.
> Follow that with a short round of running strides and call yourself ready.
> 
> That’s it! You’ve done the work, you’ve tapered the workload and properly
> diminished your fatigue, and there’s nothing more to do than rest up, nourish
> properly and reassure yourself that you’ve done what’s necessary to have your
> best possible day on Sunday. Good luck and race smart!
