# Trainer Road Plan: Half Distance Triathlon Build - Mid Volume

> Having established your fairly broad base of fitness, these Build blocks shift
> your training emphasis slightly away from intensity and more toward moderate-
> level suffering. The importance of tolerating this longer-term physiological &
> psychological challenge without succumbing to the urge to ease up is now your
> primary focus.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max + Speed Intervals (2375m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6
> w/ 5s rest between intervals; 7x75m Hard, RPE9 w/ 45s rest between intervals;
> 6x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between sprints; 8x25m K drills w/
> 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_   **Ramp Test**  With 8 weeks of base work in your legs, it's time
> to reassess your FTP in order to keep your workouts in line with your
> increasing fitness. Stick with the same workout format (Ramp Test, 8 Minute
> FTP Test or 20 Minute FTP Test) that you used the first time and count this as
> the first strength-endurance workout of your Tri Build training block.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 10min working up to Easy-Moderate,
> RPE 6 pace to warm up, then repeat 16 Hard, RPE 9, 30-second high-speed
> surges, recovering for only 30 seconds after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to
> cool down for a total of 36 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Threshold Ride + Transition Run (Brick)** Your midweek brick
> starts with a 60-minute bike workout, where you'll sustain 45 minutes of
> effort between 85-90% FTP pushing you up toward the effort you'll try to hold
> during your race-day bike leg. Then, you'll dismount and transition quickly
> into your running gear right before you take off on a very short15-minute
> transition run at a Moderate, RPE7 pace where you'll run a little faster than
> race pace and practice holding speed with somewhat fatigued legs.
> 
> _Friday_ **Pettit** Take it easy on the bike today while staying active but
> keeping recovery at the forefront of your mind.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Speed Intervals (2300m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m F &T drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/
> 45s rest between intervals; 4x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 8x25m SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Warlow** In what might be your first exposure to over-under
> intervals, this typically formatted OU workout simulates the sort of demands
> faced during a steady-state effort that involves passing or mildly powering up
> hills. It's helpful to be mentally braced for the temporary discomfort this
> brings, and it's also useful to challenge your current lactate processing
> capabilities in an effort to improve them. Welcome to almost 50 minutes of
> 'practice'.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Base Run + Strides** Run an Easy-Moderate 40 minutes at RPE6 pace
> and include 6x20-second relaxed sprints at RPE10 with 40 seconds of rest after
> each one.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2300m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE 4; 1800m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run 80min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 with as few, if any,
> walking breaks.

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Shortoff +1** The greatest benefit of VO2max works comes with
> longer durations at that high aerobic uptake. By adding a minute to each of
> these intervals, you actually gain more than a minute's benefit since this
> extra time is spent at an already highly elevated workload. But keeping things
> elevated means not taking any breaks, and if small reductions in intensity are
> necessary to keep you powering along, shave a few percentage points and keep
> those pedals turning.

> Unders, this week keeps the format very similar and therefore reasonably
> familiar but grows each interval's duration noticeably in order to continue
> raising your ability to maintain high, steady power as well as tolerate the
> burn that comes with momentarily pushing beyond your muscles' ability to
> process the metabolic fruits of your hard work.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run + Strides** This week, run an Easy-Moderate 55 minutes
> at RPE6 pace and include 8x20-second relaxed sprints at RPE10 with 40 seconds
> of rest after each one.

> frequently over the next several weeks.

> the intensity but trim your usual 1:1 work-rest ratio down to a point where
> your recoveries are a little less generous and more aerobically demanding. All

> drifting away from that high rate of respiration, and in time, greater
> improvements in sustainable power.

> sprints; 8x25m SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Carpathian Peak +2** Getting a bit more masochistic in format
> this week, you'll face a different brand of burn by gradually overload your
> muscles and then just as gradually clearing them in a more drawn out manner
> which adds up to more time spent at a high levels of lactic accumulation, less
> time spent burn-free, and in time, greater ability to hold the watts high.
>
