# Trainer Road Plan: Cross-Country Marathon - High Volume

> The Cross-Country Marathon MTB plans will prepare you for the widely varied
> and comparably long-duration nature of XCM racing by combining a focus on
> short, highly repeatable bursts of power coupled with efforts bent on driving
> up the watts and keeping them high for extended lengths of time.
> 
> Performing well over the course of a multi-hour race on unpredictable and
> varied terrain that can veer from wide open fire road to technical, rocky
> singletrack--all on subtle to severe grades--requires a well-rounded rider
> with a wide-ranging set of capabilities. Each version of this plan is intent
> on fulfilling all of these requirements and helping you realize your best
> performance at just the right time.

## Week 1

> Week 1 gets you rolling with an ever-present FTP assessment to account for any
> recent improvements in your sustainable power via our Ramp Test. You're
> welcome to use either the 20 Minute FTP Test or the 8 Minute FTP Test if
> that's your preference. In any case, try to have a day or two of recovery in
> your legs and feel ready to fairly demonstrate your current level of fitness.
> If not, consider riding easy today and postponing your assessment until
> tomorrow.  
> 
> Your midweek Endurance ride includes a couple of late-ride sprints to begin
> sharpening your more explosive power. Up next, you'll spend time riding above
> FTP. Intervals at this intensity are tremendously productive...and
> tremendously taxing. But by trimming down the interval durations and inserting
> short but adequate recovery valleys, you can accumulate quite a lot of time at
> this tough but productive output level without exhausting your muscles
> excessively.
> 
> Following an end-of-week spin to both maintain your daily routine as well as
> help your muscles clear some fatigue, your first weekend of specialized
> training begins with a round of hard-start Sweet Spot efforts that will
> accomplish a couple goals. First, you'll target your ability to generate
> _real big_  watts. Second, you'll tackle some muscle endurance work up at the
> high end of your current sustainable capabilities.
> 
> The week then closes with a round of fairly long Sweet Spot repeats to further
> address your ability to keep steady power to the pedals on longer, less
> technical stretches of trail.
> 
> Alternatively, you can swap your Sunday ride for some similar TSS trail time,
> preferably on mild, sustained climbs, or you can ride longer & slower using
> something like Koip or Laurentian.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> Your second week of cross-country race conditioning begins with a few rounds
> of short-duration/short-recovery repeats in VO2max/Anaerobic territory. As
> these short, sweet & densely packed repeats stack up, your aerobic engine will
> become increasingly involved thus taxing your muscles in multiple, effective
> ways.
> 
> Following you midweek Endurance + Sprints ride, your next workout extends the
> demands of last week’s moderately long, suprathreshold repeats by tacking on
> another minute and but also extending the recovery between all intervals.
> 
> After an easy spin, one that can be spent outdoors and target your skills,
> last week's already long, hard-start muscle endurance repeats maintain their
> duration but but ever so slightly grow the intensity of each sustained
> segment. If you find yourself in a bad spot, consider an occasional backpedal
> (no more than 30 seconds, and no more than 2 per interval) in order to keep
> your productivity and your cadence lifted. Think "smooth power", even if that
> means an infrequent and short impromptu recovery.  
> 
> Finally, you'll face a near repeat of last week's Sweet Spot repeats in order
> to continue growing your ability to tolerate long durations of sustained,
> subthreshold power. Same Sunday alternatives as last weekend: outdoors on
> sustained climbs, Koip or Laurentian.

## Week 3

> Week 3 commences with a quartet of short/short clusters that grow their
> intensity to a steady height. Last week, you may have recognized your limit in
> terms of repeatable 1-minute power. While these repeats are slightly shorter,
> feel free to dial the intensity down a notch if necessary, or simply skip an
> occasional repeat (try to limit this to per set) if it allows you to leave the
> intensity alone.
> 
> Work through another short Endurance rides plus a couple of mid-ride sprints
> and then face your longest slightly-supra-threshold intervals yet. Continue to
> challenge your current sustainable power limits as you manage the accumulating
> fatigue without easing up.
> 
> Following another end-of-week skills opportunity (or simply recovery, your
> call), this pre-recovery week begins its wrapup up by bestowing upon thee an
> opportunity to make good use of that ever-reliable backpedal tactic, should
> you need it. By drawing each post-sprint Sweet Spot effort out to a full half
> hour, you're sure to occasionally question your ability to endure the
> discomfort as you reinforce your rising ability to withstand high, but not
> too-high, watts.  
> 
> Finally, your Sunday Sweet Spot repeats stay just as long in duration but add
> a forced, mid-interval recovery to demonstrate the utility of a short recovery
> inserted into a long effort and also to provide some incentive toward staying
> on the gas as the fatigue mounts.
> 
> Yet again, some Sunday alternatives are to ride outdoors on sustained climbs
> or stay indoors and endure the likes of Koip, Conness or Laurentian.

> doses of high-intensity training that comprised much of the last few weeks.
> 
> Until you firmly grasp the benefit of proper and adequate recovery, only hard
> lessons await you out on the trail. If, however, you've recognized the benefit
> of recovery done correctly, you'll happily abide the low-intensity, same-
> training-schedule nature of this easy week.

> seconds each.

## Week 5

> With rested legs and a reinvigorated mind, it’s time for some new workout
> formats to further broaden your base of capabilities and to start to put a
> point on your high-level forms of fitness. Up first are some more
> suprathreshold repeats that hover even more closely to your FTP, but they grow
> in duration while the recovery between them shrinks. Repeatable power is one
> thing, but repeatable power following minimal recovery is a true demonstration
> of proper fitness.
> 
> Following an easy midweek ride that could be very well spent working on trail
> skills, you'll couple your hard-start prowess with your ability to accelerate,
> ease off the accelerator a bit, then maintain steady power until the end of
> the interval. Repeats like these are akin to the combination of efforts
> required to accelerate hard but briefly and then stay on the gas until the top
> of a hill or well past a competitor.
> 
> Following another recovery spin (or skills opportunity), your fifth weekend of
> the plan begins with some extended and varied Sweet Spot work bookended by a
> couple short flurries of all-out sprint efforts. Use these to simulate the
> early demands of any XC race where positioning for pivotal course segments can
> come down to a single explosive burst of power and then those late-race kicks
> that can decide the final rankings.
> 
> Then, week 5 closes with some closely-set Sweet Spot intervals interspersed
> with short but adequate recovery valleys. These are aimed at furthering your
> ability to sustain a high but manageable level of effort for increasingly
> longer periods of time, and the short recoveries drive home the point that
> productivity can benefit wildly with just a little relief.
> 
> Alternatively, Sunday can be swapped out for a similar outdoor alternative or
> perhaps BIg Mountain or Tenaya if you choose to ride indoors.

## Week 6

> First up this week, your slightly supra-threshold repeats reduce duration,
> grow in number, and become even more tightly packed together. Stands to reason
> that if you struggled with last week's short recovery valleys, extending these
> ones by a minute or two may be a good call. Alternatively, check out Jacks -1.
> 
> In either case, remember that it's not about survival, it's about
> productivity. Performing 6 high-power minutes steadily and with proper
> pedaling mechanics is far superior training than 5 minutes of fighting the
> bike and repeatedly falling apart during the final minute.
> 
> Following another skills-appropriate midweek spin, this week's iteration of
> hard starts + Threshold efforts simply ups the demand of the initial sprint
> while leaving the rest of each interval the same. This is likely to inspire
> slightly greater fatigue during the initial minutes of each steady-state, but
> half the challenge of this interval format is pushing through the pain and
> keeping the power steady all the way to and through that final second. Push
> _past_  that rider in front of you, push  _past_  the top of that hill.  
> 
> After another recovery or skills session, this final, pre-taper weekend then
> begins with another version of your previous Sprints + Sweet Spot workouts and
> then closes out with This pre-taper week then closes with some longer Sweet
> Spot repeats that can be skipped in lieu of some similar-effort outdoor riding
> or some long, mild work done indoors or out. Good indoor alternatives are
> still Laurentian or Conness and an outdoor equivalent with some skills work
> woven in is highly encouraged.

> Alternatively, you can move Crane +1 to Friday if you'd like to make the week

> 
> If for some reason you aren't racing this weekend, it's a good idea to slot in

> Otherwise, go toe the start line with a rested and primed body along with a
