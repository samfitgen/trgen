# Trainer Road Plan: Cyclocross - Mid Volume

> The Cyclocross specialty plans will prepare you for the widely varied nature
> of 'cross racing by addressing the need for high-end sustainable power, the
> ability to generate high levels of force at very low cadences, and the
> development of repeated, high-power outputs following little if any recovery.  
> 
> Some cyclocross racers play things strategically, some exploit their technical
> finesse, some capitalize on an outright willingness to suffer. All rely on a
> high level of wide-ranging fitness which is exactly the aim of our Cyclocross
> plans.

## Week 1

> Beginning with your final scheduled FTP assessment, you'll measure improvement
> garnered during your preceding Build plan in order to reestablish your power
> levels. Cyclocross being what it is, your Build plan may have been the Short
> Power, Sustained Power  **or**  the General Build training plan - such as the
> variability in the demands of 'cross racing is.  
> 
> Post-assessment, your first evident shift toward anaerobic efforts will come
> via some sprints plunked into the midst of what will usually be a midweek
> aerobic endurance ride. You'll then face what promises to be the first of many
> workouts aimed at peaking your ability to operate at a high level of your
> aerobic capacity. VO2max work is beneficial both in terms of its training
> adaptations as well as its similarity to the type of efforts required when
> racing on highly to mildly technical 'cross courses.
> 
> You'll then begin your weekend with your first weekly race-simulation workout.
> Composed of  _reduced amplitude-Billats_ , these little honeys will find you
> going full-gas, or attempting to recover at a level of effort well above
> typical recovery power output. But again, such is the nature of cyclocross
> racing.
> 
> You'll close out your first week of specialized training with some Sweet Spot
> repeats aimed at reinforcing your ability to sustain watts near, but below,
> your FTP for long stretches. Each of these repeats kicks off with another
> small dose of sprint work to both awaken your fast-twitch fibers as well as
> simulate the hard-start explosiveness so often encountered in a race.
> 
> If you'd rather ride longer and slower on Sunday, try Koip or Springer
> Mountain or head outdoors for a similar-TSS ride performed somewhere around
> 65% FTP.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!


### Wednesday

### Saturday 

* **Name**: Sassafras
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 121.0
* **NP**: 180

**Description**:

> Sassafras is a pyramid-style VO2max workout that grows the number of 15/15's
> (120% FTP/88% FTP) as high as 14 per set before stepping back down to where it
> started at 4, quick repeats.
> 
> Occasional 88% FTP floats last 15-30 seconds and still short but relatively

* **IF**: 84%

**Description**:

> Bondcliff is made up of 4x15-minute race-start intervals that each begin with
> a 30-second surge at 150% FTP and then quickly settles in at 88% FTP for the
> remaining 14 minutes.
> 
> Each interval is separated by 3 minutes of recovery.

## Week 2

> Week 2 sees the introduction of work dedicated solely to lifting your
> anaerobic power capabilities. This form of finishing work addresses your
> short-power capabilities by demanding possibly your highest indoor power
> outputs but only for short to very short durations. See these for what they
> are: short but painful bursts of power that cultivate raw strength and lift
> your overall work capacity.
> 
> Your toned-down midweek butter-burner can be a great time to get outdoors and
> integrate some skills work into your lighter, aerobic riding. Just make sure
> not to overdo the effort level and come into tomorrow's high-intensity workout
> flat.
> 
> Speaking of which, this week you'll grow your VO2max interval duration by a
> slim but meaningful duration over last week's repeats. The goal here isn't to
> generate more watts but to hold high, supra-FTP power numbers for slightly
> longer durations thereby lifting your capabilities to lay down and  _sustain_
> high power output.
> 
> Weekend two begins with a different and mildly lighter round of race-
> simulating, high-power-recovery VO2max repeats. Use this as an opportunity to
> further familiarize yourself with the incessantly punishing nature of racing
> on the widest ranging terrain imaginable.
> 
> You'll close out this second week of specialized conditioning with a Sprint +
> Sweet Spot workout very similar to last week's, only this weekend the
> sustained segments grow in duration while still adding up to the same overall
> work duration.  
> 
> Prefer to keep things lighter and longer? Consider the same options as last
> week with Koip being the gentlest (and longest), Springer Mountain
> incorporating a handful of sprint efforts, or some outdoor mileage that
> ideally includes a bit of skill work.

> remaining 19 minutes.
> 
> Each interval is separated by 5 minutes of recovery.

## Week 3

> Week 3’s first round of intervals focuses again on honing your ability to put
> down extremely high watts for very limited (but often pivotal) lengths of
> time. Whether you create big power with a fast spin, big gear, or a bit of
> each, this capability doesn't appear magically for most of us. It takes a few
> weeks of work dedicated to cultivating a very specific and useful form of
> fitness.
> 
> Following your easy, midweek aerobic-maintenance spin - one where you'd do
> well to get outside and address some 'cross skills - your VO2max durations hit
> their peak. While you may have done longer repeats in other training phases,
> it's likely that your peak-aerobic-uptake power has never been higher than it
> is right now. So yes, you'll again grow the ever-important duration, but
> you'll do it at your highest level of work  _quality_  to date.
> 
> Then, one last time, you'll face several varied-length bouts of race-specific
> repeats. This time, the recovery between each muscular assault has been
> minimized and moves you closer to the demands of mass-start racing on courses
> that funnel riders into fitness-contingent positioning. Put another way, only
> the strongest rise to the front of the field.
> 
> Week 3 then ends with your longest Sweet Spot repeats of the plan. And yes,
> they still kick off with a 1.5x FTP sprint to further your ability to recruit
> a lot of muscle fiber all at once while also sending you into a long repeat
> with a little extra fatigue in your legs.  
> 
> Your longer/slower alternatives are the same as usual: Koip, Springer Mountain
> or enough outdoor mileage to accumulate your target TSS while holding your
> power pretty close to 65% FTP.

> 
> Each interval is separated by 7 minutes of recovery.

## Week 4

> Many low-volume athletes find they don't need an entire week of recovery-
> intensity riding in order to continue lifting their fitness. Some, however,
> need every single day of it. Base your recovery approach on earlier phases of
> training and how you felt during the latter half of your recovery weeks as
> well as how you felt directly following them.
> 
> In this plan's only week of dedicated downtime, consider a couple options.
> First off, you can follow the recovery protocol just as it's laid out if
> you've reached this fourth week in evident need of some RandR.
> 
> Alternatively, you can adhere to the recovery workout guidelines but do so
> outdoors where you can work on some of your most lacking cyclocross skills.
> Come the weekend, you could even insert a harder, full-intensity workout.
> Ideally, you'd compete in a cyclocross or even XC mountain bike race, but a
> repeat of any of the preceding weeks' Saturday workouts will suffice.

## Week 5

> Following a bit of deloading that ideally finds you returning with a
> revitalized body and some renewed training motivation, it’s time to get even
> more specific with your final few weeks of training. This begins by coupling
> two previous workout types into a single format by adding an anaerobic burst
> of power to the beginning of your race-simulating VO2max repeats.
> 
> At this point in the plan, the utility of your midweek aerobic maintenance
> ride has probably become apparent. The intention is to both facilitate
> recovery as well as maintain aerobic efficiency. Even at fairly low power
> outputs, these short workouts can have a negative impact on the following
> day's high-intensity workout. If you've found this to be the case, either
> reduce its intensity by 10-15% and focus solely on the restorative aspects of
> this training opportunity or skip the ride entirely and get a day of complete
> rest. Of course, skills work is still a recommended option.
> 
> Up next, what were once straightforward aerobic capacity repeats morph into
> ostensibly anaerobic repeats. These short, intense intervals are so closely
> stacked that each subsequent repeat within a set grows increasingly aerobic in
> nature thereby making high demands - and reaping multiple training benefits -
> on both major metabolic systems. High power? Check. Repeatability? Check.
> Higher performance capabilities? Check.
> 
> Then, a new end-of-week interval format couples high-power starts with a
> returned focus on fortifying your muscular endurance as you lead into your
> most important events. Practice pushing hard and then settling into a pace
> that will drop most fools who try to follow your moves, all while you
> strengthen your ability to hold high percentages of your FTP for increasing
> durations.
> 
> Finally, some straightforward Sweet Spot work awaits. Having already done a
> healthy amount of anaerobic work and race simulation, these efforts focus
> solely on reinforcing your muscular endurance - or your aerobic endurance
> should you choose a longer, slower alternative like Laurentian, Koip, Springer
> Mountain, or some outdoor equivalent.

## Week 6

> Week 6 begins with a near repeat of last week's race interval combo, but with
> a slight increase in the intensity of your opening hard start as well as the
> high-intensity surges throughout each interval. Do your best to follow this
> high-force push with an increasingly smooth set of VO2max repeats. Even though
> it's virtually the same workout as last week, it doesn't have to be ridden the
> same way. Try to minimize any wasteful movement on the bike, any unnecessary
> muscle tension through your body, and any lack of control as each set
> progresses and your fatigue mounts.
> 
> Following another midweek aerobic-maintenance ride, you'll face what might at
> first appear to be a second repeat workout. This weeks' anaerobic-to-aerobic
> power repeats trim the recovery between intervals only slightly, but the
> impact this seemingly minor change can have on a workout, a race, and of
> course, your fitness, can be nothing short of tremendous, especially as the
> repeats stack up.
> 
> Then your end-of-week combination workout kicks off with slightly more intense
> bursts of power before following the same format as last weekend. The overall
> stress of the workout barely changes, but the demands of each interval could
> rise substantially depending on where your 30-second power tops out. Use this
> information to inform later workouts and refine your approach to actual race
> scenarios where a too-hard opening sprint can come at a far greater expense.
> 
> Close the week with another round of straightforward Sweet Spot repeats, or
> choose from the same options as last week for a lighter-intensity, longer
> ride.
