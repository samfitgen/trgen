# Trainer Road Plan: Sprint Triathlon Build - High Volume

> As athletes draw closer to their events, more specific conditioning becomes
> the focus of each subsequent training block. The increased focus on Threshold
> and VO2max work here make it abundantly clear that Sprint triathlons require
> speed in even measure with endurance

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim VO2max + Sprint Intervals (2450m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 6x50m CU Drill; 8x100m Hard, RPE9 w/ 60s rest between intervals; 8x50m
> Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between sprints; 10x25m K Drills w/ 15s
> rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Ramp Test** With 4 weeks of base work in your legs, it's time to
> reassess your FTP in order to keep your workouts in line with your increasing
> fitness. Stick with the same workout format (Ramp Test, 8 Minute FTP Test or
> 20 Minute FTP Test) that you used the first time and count this as the first
> strength-endurance workout of your Tri Build training block.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2800m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 6x50m F
> &T Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x200m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 10s rest
> between intervals; 4x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals;
> Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Run Speed Intervals** Run 15min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 to
> warm up, then perform 15x30-second, All-Out, high-speed efforts, RPE10 with 2
> minutes of recovery running, RPE4 between each; cool down for 10 Easy minutes,
> RPE4 for about 60 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Mills** Upping the volume of your hardest VO2max workout to date
> by a full set of 3 intervals may sound a bit hefty, but these 'peak and fade'
> repeats are a little more forgiving than the steadier format, and there's even
> a little bit of rest between each set. So if you made intensity reductions to
> in the past, see how a few of these intervals go before making reductions here
> - you may be pleasantly surprised.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Recovery Run** Run 40 minutes Easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Friday_ **Lazy Mountain** Coming off of yesterday's introduction to VO2max
> work, your fatigue may be a little unpredictable. If you feel good, ride for
> an easy hour; feel terrible though, and cut this as short as 20 minutes.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Sprint Intervals (2450m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy,
> RPE4; 6x50m F Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/
> 30s rest between intervals; 8x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 10s rest between
> sprints; 10x25m K &R Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
> RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Mount Hope** Riding near but below FTP can be more productive
> than training at FTP in that the training benefit is similar but the recovery
> time is reduced thereby allowing more time spent training, less time spent
> recovering. And by effectively raising your base of strength-endurance, you'll
> pave the way for later work sustained slightly above your FTP, as in the case
> of a 20k bike leg. Try to spend at least half of each interval in your aero
> position, even if you achieve this by alternating equal minutes down low with
> minutes sitting upright.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Tempo Run** Run 10min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE6 to warm up, then
> run steadily, Moderate-Hard, RPE8 for 26 minutes; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to
> cool down for a total of about 46 minutes of running
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2500m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE 4; 1,800m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** Run 60 minutes Easy-Moderate, RPE 6

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> _Tuesday_ **Shortoff +1** The greatest benefit of VO2max works comes with
> longer durations at that high aerobic uptake. By adding a minute to each of
> these intervals, you actually gain more than a minute's benefit since this
> extra time is spent at an already highly elevated workload. But keeping things
> elevated means not taking any breaks, and if small reductions in intensity are
> necessary to keep you powering along, shave a few percentage points and keep
> those pedals turning.

> 
> _Thursday_ **Recovery Run** Run 40 minutes Easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Friday_ **Lazy Mountain** With 2 days of suprathreshold intervals in your

> easy, RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Mount Goode** Yet another drop in total workout duration
> accompanied by another increase in interval duration. Each of these relatively
> long efforts will again hold you just below your highest sustainable power for
