# Trainer Road Plan: Half Distance Triathlon - High Volume

> With the necessary endurance & strength in the bank, the objective becomes
> growing as familiar as possible with the very specific demands of racing long
> but not really long. This challenging mix of speed & endurance demands the
> very particular preparation offered over the course of this final pre-race
> block of training.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max Intervals (3100m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4;
> 12x25m BB Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 9x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 8x100m Hard, RPE9 w/ 60s rest between intervals;
> 12x25m K &R drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 400m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Ramp Test** It's pretty likely you've seen some improvement over
> the course of your Build phase, so we'll begin this specialized training phase
> by reassessing your FTP such that the final weeks leading up to your most
> important races are appropriately demanding and as productive as possible. Use
> the same test format you've used before, and make sure you feel rested and
> motivated heading into this workout.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (3000m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 6x50m F
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x200m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 10s rest
> between intervals; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals;
> Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Tempo Repeats Run** Run 10min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE6 to warm
> up, then run steadily, Moderate-Hard, RPE8 2 times for 20 minutes each and
> recover at an Easy, RPE2 pace for 10 minutes between each; run 10min Easy, RPE
> 4 to cool down for a total of 70 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Gibraltar + Endurance Run (Brick)** In the midst of another
> 1hr45min bike workout, you'll sustain 90 minutes of effort between 80-85% FTP
> which is likely to be close to the effort you'll try to hold during your race-
> day bike leg. You'll then dismount and transition quickly into your running
> gear right before you take off on a 60-minute run at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6
> pace as you practice managing your run pace for a comparatively long stretch
> of time.
> 
> _Friday_ **Townsend** Each of the 8 weeks ahead is likely to end in this
> workout or one very similar to it. Use this ride to accumulate a little extra
> aerobic endurance work, to practice and refine your aero positioning, and to
> keep your muscles pliable and reasonably refreshed. And always feel free to
> trim the duration of this workout if you recognize that you're carrying too
> much fatigue into a demanding weekend of training.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Speed Intervals (3000m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4;
> 12x25m FS drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 3x400m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 75s
> rest between intervals; 8x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 12x25m SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 400m easy,
> RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Gasherbrum** Having finished up with a 4.25-hour endurance ride
> during your Build training, this first long ride only tacks on another 15
> minutes with the twin goals of keeping your aerobic endurance in place and
> further familiarizing you with the many challenges that accompany these long,
> steady-effort rides.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 15-20min working up to Easy-Moderate,
> RPE 6 pace to warm up, then have a go at 5x2-minute Hard, RPE9 high-speed
> surges with 2 minute's recovery after each; run 10min Easy, RPE4 to cool down
> for about 50 minutes of running
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (3000m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE 4; 2400m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Nudge up your longest run again, this time to
> 2hrs10min at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6 pace.

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> _Tuesday_ **Jacks +1** Same rules as last week regarding riding in your aero

> _Saturday_ **Kailash** Another bump in your longest ride puts you at 4.75

> do it indoors? Perhaps, but knowing that you can hunker down and keep the
