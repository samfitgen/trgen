# Trainer Road Plan: Sprint Triathlon Build - Mid Volume

> As athletes draw closer to their events, more specific conditioning becomes
> the focus of each subsequent training block. The increased focus on Threshold
> and VO2max work here make it abundantly clear that Sprint triathlons require
> speed in even measure with endurance

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_   **Ramp Test**  With 4 weeks of base work in your legs, it's time
> to reassess your FTP in order to keep your workouts in line with your
> increasing fitness. Stick with the same workout format (Ramp Test, 8 Minute
> FTP Test or 20 Minute FTP Test) that you used the first time and count this as
> the first strength-endurance workout of your Tri Build training block.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim VO2max + Sprint Intervals (1850m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 8x75m Hard, RPE9 w/ 45s rest
> between intervals; 6x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between sprints;
> 6x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 10-15min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6
> to warm up, then repeat 16 Hard, RPE 9, 30-second near-sprints, recovering for
> only 30 seconds after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down for a total of
> about 40 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Mills** Upping the volume of your hardest VO2max workout to date
> by a full set of 3 intervals may sound a bit hefty, but these 'peak and fade'
> repeats are a little more forgiving than the steadier format, and there's even
> a little bit of rest between each set. So if you made intensity reductions to
> in the past, see how a few of these intervals go before making reductions here
> - you may be pleasantly surprised.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Sprint Intervals (1850m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m F &T Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 4x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8
> w/ 45s rest between intervals; 4x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest
> between sprints; 6x25m SK Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m
> easy, RPE4
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run + Strides** Run 15-20 minutes up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6
> to warm thoroughly, then perform 6x20-second relaxed sprints with 40 seconds
> of regular, RPE6 running in between them; finish the run with 20 Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6 minutes for about 45 minutes of running
> 
> _Saturday_ **Ruskin** Working this close to FTP takes focus and the ability to
> cope with the inevitable discomfort that comes with sustaining a workload this
> high. Efforts like these prepare your mind for the even higher demands that
> accompany riding a little above your FTP during a race-paced, bike leg, and
> they do this while also lifting your ability to hold high watts for longer
> durations.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** Run 45 minutes Easy-Moderate, RPE 6
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (1600m)** Warm-Up 200m Easy, RPE 4; 1,200m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 200m easy, RPE 4

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 3

> _Tuesday_ **Shortoff +1** The greatest benefit of VO2max works comes with
> longer durations at that high aerobic uptake. By adding a minute to each of
> these intervals, you actually gain more than a minute's benefit since this
> extra time is spent at an already highly elevated workload. But keeping things
> elevated means not taking any breaks, and if small reductions in intensity are
> necessary to keep you powering along, shave a few percentage points and keep
> those pedals turning.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim VO2max + Sprint Intervals (1850m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m SA Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 8x75m Hard, RPE9 w/ 20s rest

> of about 45 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Mount Hope -2** Interval time comes down a bit, but total
> duration rises just a little with the intent of increasing your ability to
> 'keep your foot on the gas'. Make sure you're spending ample time in your aero
> position if you plan to race in it.
