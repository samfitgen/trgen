# Trainer Road Plan: Climbing Road Race - Low Volume

> Shaping a capable road racer -- whose events require everything from short,
> near maximal efforts to all-out bursts of speed to long stretches of endurance
> work and, in this case, multiple bouts of sustained climbing -- requires a
> plan that hones the entire spectrum of performance capabilities.
> 
> Accordingly, the emphasis is split between high-power, often explosive efforts
> and extended, near-FTP efforts that all find their way into a road race,
> beginning, middle or end, flats or climbs, pointless or purposeful.
> 
> The low-volume version of the Climbing Road Race specialty plan has riders on
> the bike 3 times each week for 60-90 minutes up until weeks 7 and 8 which
> provide taper formats that can be repeated during a busy race season.
> Typically, B-priority events go well following Week 7's format while Week 8's
> even lower volume lends itself nicely to A-priority weekends.
> 
> Substitute any outdoor races or training rides for your scheduled workouts
> when appropriate, but do your best to make these substitutions at least as
> challenging as the workout you're skipping.

## Week 1

> As per usual, your season's final bout of training begins with an opportunity
> to assess improvements in your sustainable power in order to accurately adjust
> your power levels. While the Ramp Test is recommended, you're welcome to use
> the 20 Minute FTP Test of the 8 Minute FTP Test if that's your preference.  
> 
> Following your FTP reassessment, you’ll get your first dose of sustained,
> suprathreshold climbing repeats where you’ll begin to practice the art of
> repeated climbing surges.
> 
> Then you’ll cap off your first week with a race-fashioned workout that begins
> with some early, high-power sprints to keep your _big-watts_ capabilities
> sharp while the remainder of the workout consists of  less intense, fairly
> long muscle endurance repeats which are separated by just enough time to clear
> your head but perhaps not your muscles. You’ll know if your aerobic engine is
> firing on all cylinders based on how ready you feel for each subsequent
> interval.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 2

> Week 2 begins with a series of varied _attack & recover_ intervals that ask
> you to bounce back and forth between hard work and all-out effort with only
> brief recoveries between these short intervals thereby simulating the
> tumultuous barrage of efforts seen during any aggressive road race.
> 
> Up next, you'll grow last week's performance at intensities just above FTP by
> adding a little more duration to each repeat and a little more volume to the
> workout as a whole. These efforts are bent on furthering your ability to
> sustain slightly supra-threshold watts and eke out any final increases in your
> longer-term sustainable power.
> 
> Finally, a near repeat of last week's race-like ride awaits where you'll again
> bang out some early sprint practice before settling into a handful of
> reasonably lengthy stretches of Sweet Spot & Threshold training.

## Week 3

> Week 3 starts with another jam-packed workout consisting of initial hard
> charges that dovetail into near-Threshold work in order to familiarize you
> with the process of doling out big, anaerobically inclined efforts followed
> immediately by some _legs-don't-fail-me-now_  sustained watts. Intervals like
> these and last week's mixed-format efforts cultivate a rider resistant to
> shameful 'attack & explode' antics. Nobody wants to be the one who jumps away
> from the field only to fall apart a minute or two later.  
>   
> Up next, the final duration increase in your suprathreshold efforts will ask
> you to stay a little above your FTP for the longest stretches of time yet, but
> master these multi-minute repeats and watch as even your most motivated
> competitors fall off your wheel as you hit 'em again and again.  
>   
> This third week concludes with one more early-sprint strength-endurance
> workout to keep your sprint sharp and your ability to endure high watts fully
> intact.

> on all cylinders without accumulating high amounts of counterproductive,
> performance-degrading stress.

> If you feel as though you're truly rested and ready to resume your upward-
> performance trajectory by the weekend, feel free to do a bit of work on
> Saturday as long as it doesn't send you into week 5 carrying too much fatigue
> for your final round of high-intensity workouts.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 5

> As you work your way toward your taper and race weeks, the workouts grow
> increasingly specific to the often brutal demands of mass-start racing on
> punchy, rolling courses.
> 
> You're welcome to use today to reassess changes in your FTP, but due to the
> shift from a focus on building fitness to one on honing fitness, you may not
> see substantial changes in your FTP during this specialized phase of training.
> Alternatively, you can simply add 1-3% to your FTP if you suspect a slight
> bump in your Functional Threshold Power.
> 
> If you choose to skip the FTP reassessment, your first workout is what would
> otherwise be a straightforward set of Threshold repeats except that each
> interval is sprinkled with very short and sharp bursts of power that serve to
> keep your fast-twitch fibers alert and available but also to familiarize you
> with the skill of surging briefly without falling off the pace afterward.
> 
> Then you'll face a more interesting, race-like round of VO2max repeats where
> the high-end aerobic intervals are separated by a tiny bit of recovery and a
> short stretch of Tempo rather than the usual recovery valleys. Grouping these
> max-aerobic-power efforts in this manner is in line with the demands faced
> when long climbs start to break up as racers move toward the summit.
> 
> Finally, your first of a few progression workouts awaits. This format lumps
> together several suprathreshold efforts separated by minimal amounts of rest
> keeping things similar to the escalating intensity of a race. They also pay
> due attention to the energy system responsible for rapid recovery following
> each above-FTP effort as well the system responsible for laying down big watts
> - your aerobic (fat burning) and anaerobic (sugar burning) engines,
> respectively.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 6

> Week 6 begins a soon-to-be-familiar pattern of work as each workout remains
> the same in nature but decreases substantially in volume, starting with your
> first workout of the week and its  _surge & attack_ efforts. The goal with
> each interval is to give it nearly everything you have as the effort required
> only ascends reaching a brief crescendo of all-out misery. Think anyone else
> is working this hard?
> 
> Then things get toned down closer to your FTP while still including a fair
> amount of work done near your VO2max. What's more, the oh-so-short recoveries
> between each interval will keep your heart, lungs, and muscles primed and
> ready for the next effort thereby taking full advantage of the robust aerobic
> system you've built over weeks and weeks of hard work.
> 
> Your weekend serves up a near repeat of last weekend's progression format,
> only this time the recovery valleys are slightly shorter placing a greater
> reliance on your aerobic system's ability to clear the junk and process the
> usable excesses.

## Week 7

> Time to dial things back and let any further fitness buried underneath your
> fatigue begin to rise to the surface. We’ll keep the intensity, cut the volume
> way back, and start to gradually taper things down to a bare minimum that
> finds you as fresh as possible in about 2 weeks' time.
> 
> Both weekday workouts are trimmed down versions of what you saw last week
> aiming to keep your muscles and mind attuned to the intensity while reducing
> the overall training load in order to recover some freshness without
> sacrificing any fitness in the process.
> 
> Your weekend workout also sees a reduction in volume but retains its necessary
> intensity as you're guided through another mounting round of efforts that
> address nearly every form of fitness you'll employ come raceday.
> 
> This week can serve as a taper for any week leading into a B-priority weekend,
> so feel free to repeat this schedule anytime you want a bit more stress than
> next week's race-week format. Consider including an  _openers_  workout the
> day prior to your race, something like Truuli or its shorter versions.

## Week 8

> Entering what’s likely to be your first of many Race weeks to come (assuming
> you’re not already racing), you’ll need to decide which workouts will take
> place indoors and which will be skipped in lieu of training races or higher-
> priority events.
> 
> You’ll also have to decide on the number of weeks that you’re looking to
> maintain your peak fitness since it typically begins to decline after 4-5
> weeks for most riders. Some riders can hold this fitness for longer periods,
> some for less. But in most cases, this race-week taper structure can be
> repeated quite often with only minor tweaking depending on your race schedule.
> 
> A weekday training race plus one of the scheduled weekday workouts or simply
> the two reduced-volume workouts slated before Friday will work well for most
> riders looking to shed a little more fatigue and stay sharp leading into the
> weekend. There's also the option of an _openers_ workout scheduled the day
> prior to your event, and this can require a bit of rearrangement each week
> such that you don't carry any residual fatigue into your important events.
> 
> Whatever you decide, try to allow for a day of rest following each day of
> training - the single exception is an openers workout since a race will always
> fall on the following day.
> 
> OK, you’ve done the work, you have the fitness, now go out there with
> confidence knowing that you’ve done everything necessary to get the job done.
