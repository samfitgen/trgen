# Trainer Road Plan: Sustained Power Build - Low Volume

## Week 1

> As you'd expect, Week 1 offers your first crack at assessing any improvements
> in fitness that your base training may have conveyed. While the Ramp Test is
> recommended, you're welcome to swap it with our 20 Minute FTP Test or 8 Minute
> FTP Test if you prefer that format.
> 
> You'll next move on to a round of over-unders which will help you get an even
> better feel for where exactly you cross that lactic line while you reinforce
> your ability to sustain near-FTP watts, both above and below but never far
> from your threshold power.
> 
> Then, the week wraps up with what promises to be a recurring end-of-week theme
> in the form of Threshold work done very near, but always below, your FTP. The
> goal is straightforward improvements in your ability to sustain Functional
> Threshold Power for increasing durations.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 2

> Making the most of a low-volume routine requires a bit of the hard stuff, in
> particular, some VO2max work. Accordingly, Week 2 begins with your first taste
> of maximum aerobic power repeats where their work intervals are stacked
> closely and the mid-interval recoveries are just long enough to shed some, but
> certainly not all, muscle fatigue.
> 
> Up next, another round of muscle burning over-unders will lift the over-
> segments to a higher but more productively painful level of power output
> before gradually stepping your effort back down barely enough to ready you for
> the next round of abuse.
> 
> You'll finish out the week with a slightly longer round of Threshold repeats
> that will continue to grow your ability to sustain high levels of your FTP for
> reasonably long durations.

## Week 3

> Verging on your first recovery week allows us to lift the demand across all
> three workouts during week 3. You'll first up the duration of last week's
> VO2max efforts but also lengthen the duration of the recovery valleys in the
> hopes of balancing the work and rest in such a way that you can complete every
> single 90-second work interval.
> 
> Your next round of muscle endurance-enhancing over-unders will hold you above
> your FTP for an extra minute this week while you employ your ever-increasing
> aerobic capabilities to good effect and clear that mild, acidic excess without
> sacrificing power while you do it. Then, your weekend culminates in the
> longest round of Threshold repeats you've yet faced, again aimed at improving
> your ability to power on in the face of fatigue.

## Week 5

> In the event your sustainable power has increased, we'll want to adjust your
> training zones appropriately. So Week 5 begins with a Ramp Test, an assessment
> workout you're welcome to switch for the 8 Minute FTP Test or the 20 Minute
> FTP Test based on whichever format helps you remain consistent over the course
> of your season.
> 
> Then it's onto some lactate tolerance work where instead of staying below the
> point where your muscles flood, the objective is to sustain the burn and
> benefit from the discomfort in the process. If you think the short, 3-minute
> recoveries aren't quite long enough to keep you hanging in there, consider
> Stevens +2 in order to ensure that you're getting as much benefit as possible
> from each demanding effort.
> 
> The weekend brings with it a return to the muscle-endurance building efforts
> just below your recently improved FTP. And as you'd expect, you'll spend more
> time there. These long efforts are punctuated with recoveries that might feel
> insufficient in terms of resting you enough for another long round of
> Threshold work, so pause the workout for an extra minute or two of easy
> spinning if it helps you maintain a higher level of quality throughout each
> long repeat.

Rest Day

## Week 6

> Week 6's initial challenge pits you against 3 sets of substantially longer
> aerobic capacity intervals that will challenge your muscles as thoroughly as
> your heart & lungs. Each one of these is a small accomplishment, but a
> workout's worth of them can stir adaptation in even the fittest of athletes.
> 
> You'll next face some mercilessly longer lactate tolerance repeats. Much like
> last week, if the short recoveries aren't ones that will allow you to rally
> and survive the bulk of each interval, consider Mt Hale -1 in order to
> continue to maximize the training benefit from these slightly supra-threshold
> work bouts.
> 
> This week's final workout consists of some fairly lengthy Threshold repeats
> that continue to target your repeatable, sustainable power output. And again,
> if the recoveries aren't quite enough to revitalize you, pause the workout for
> an extra minute or two between intervals.

## Week 7

> Week 7 kicks off with a bigger, badder set of VO2max repeats bent on
> furthering your ability to manage the discomfort necessary to really stress
> your aerobic system's capacity, but only for an additional 30 seconds at a
> time.
> 
> Then you're pitted against a familiar round of slightly supra-threshold
> repeats where the intervals get a little shorter but the total workout volume
> grows a little. Based on previous week's' experience, you may again to decide
> to lengthen the recovery valleys by doing Dicks -2 if you don't mind a little
> extra time on the bike.  
> 
> Finally, your week finishes off with another 60 minutes hugging the lower
> limit of your FTP where, once again, the recoveries are short in the interest
> of getting you on and off the bike in minimal time. But adding just an extra
> minute or two between these intervals is still a welcome and encouraged option
> if you have the time and need the added relief.

## Week 8

> Having made it through 7 demanding weeks of Sustained Power Build
> conditioning, it's again time to rest up with a near repeat of Week 4's
> recovery cycle.
> 
> And by repeating your recovery weeks in almost identical fashion, you're
> provided with an opportunity to modify your recovery workloads to fit your
> particular recovery profile. Did your last recovery week leave you feeling a
> bit too tired to dive back into training? Perhaps you didn't need quite as
> much rest as you were given.
> 
> Whatever the case, highly similar recovery weeks provide a consistent protocol
> that can be altered as necessary such that you feel eager and rested heading
> into your next round of training without feeling like you backed off too far.
