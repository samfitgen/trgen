# Trainer Road Plan: Criterium - High Volume

> The Criterium plans will prepare you for the highly dynamic nature of crit
> racing by placing heavy emphasis on peaking your high, repeatable power output
> without neglecting your ability to sustain big power for comparably longer
> durations.
> 
> Whether you're the type of racer who excels via the use of short, explosive
> bouts of work or the type that favors strategic breakaway efforts, the
> Criterium plans are for you!

## Week 1

> Week 1 begins with an all-important reassessment of your FTP via the Ramp
> Test. You're welcome to follow another assessment format if you prefer, as
> long as it's a reliable and consistent protocol.
> 
> Following a slightly longer than usual aerobic spin, your second interval
> workout of the week is a handful of efforts at a realistically high percentage
> of your newly estimated FTP. The primary intention here is to make good use of
> your intermediate muscle fibers--the ones you'll call on frequently over the
> course of just about any highly demanding criterium.
> 
> Following an end-of-week spin, your first weekend of specialized training
> begins with a highly specialized interval format that likely faced as part of
> the Short Power Build plan. Emulating the nature of criterium racing where
> you're either fully pinned or working  _just hard enough to stay with the
> pack/just easy enough to keep from passing out_ , the recoveries between these
> very short, very intense intervals only fall to Sweet Spot watts as opposed to
> the usual recovery effort level.
> 
> Week 1 then closes with a bit of focus on elevating both your ability to
> generate extremely high power for a substantial duration - 30 brutal but
> potentially impactful seconds - and then shifts focus to lifting your ability
> to sustain a high percentage of your FTP immediately afterward. By coupling
> high-force work with muscle endurance efforts, each of these intervals serves
> as its own breakaway simulation while reinforcing two important components of
> aggressive criterium racing.  
> 
> If you'd rather ride longer but at a lighter level of intensity, consider
> Boarstone +3, Big Squaw or Flattop if you'd like to include some sprints.
> Alternatively, head outdoors for an Endurance ride between 60-70% FTP, with a
> handful of sprints thrown in, and work to accumulate roughly the same TSS as
> the scheduled workout.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> Week 2 introduces a form of training that's far more intent on raising your
> anaerobic power than other workouts that split their focus between multiple
> training impacts. This workout is one of a handful of workouts devoted solely
> to anaerobic power improvement as later workouts are reasonably bent on making
> your anaerobic power translate to increasingly race-like scenarios.
> 
> Following a short Endurance ride aimed at active recovery as well as aerobic
> maintenance, your next workout grows last week's intervals only marginally
> with the addition of an extra minute which keeps things manageable but
> progressively more challenging. This is the very nature of chasing training
> adaptation and one you're probably quite familiar with by now.
> 
> After another short, aerobic spin, the weekend begins with another iteration
> of last week's short/short efforts, but this time follows a "pyramid"
> structure where the duration of each interval rises to a peak and then
> descends back down to a repeat of the shorter intervals that kicked off the
> workout in order to keep things mildly more interesting and productively
> varied.
> 
> The weekend then closes with a near repeat of last week's hard-start strength-
> endurance intervals where the post-jump Sweet Spot intensity rises slightly
> and tasks you with sustaining a slightly higher percentage of your FTP for a
> quarter hour at a time.
> 
> Feel free to go the longer/slower route Town Hill, Grandfather if you want to
> include a few sprints, or head outdoors and log some Endurance mileage while
> you accumulate a couple minutes of sprinting.

> 
> Each interval is separated by 8 minutes of recovery.

## Week 3

> The second of your four Anaerobic workouts trims the recoveries down a bit,
> but make no mistake, this workout still emphasizes force over conditioning.
> These descending intervals (time descends, power rises) offer equal-time
> recovery keeping the anaerobic vs aerobic balance a little heavier on the
> anaerobic side. The secondary aim is to bring you closer to the demands of
> races where the importance of high-power  _repetition  _far outweighs the
> possibility of a 30-second power PR.
> 
> Spin off some of the heaviness inflicted from your anaerobic endeavors, and
> then your varied VO2max-ish repeats maintain the very same workload as last
> week but with the addition of yet another minute per interval aiming to
> increase your high-power aptitude even more. The difference in hitting it hard
> for 6 minutes compared to a hard 4 or 5 minutes is often the difference
> between winning and falling out of the top 20. Possible results aside, the
> shock to your aerobically driven system can't help but yield greater race
> capabilities; again,  **given proper and adequate  recovery**.
> 
> Following Friday's aerobic spin, this third weekend begins your lightest round
> of short intervals, still with those same unforgivingly high recovery valleys
> but toned down a bit in overall training load due to the brute you'll face
> tomorrow.
> 
> Speaking of which, you'll close your third week of specialized loading and
> refinement with a noticeably more demanding set of stomp and sustain intervals
> that now lift the 15-minute sustained-power stretches all the way up to a
> point where they nearly hug your FTP. Learn to endure indoor efforts like
> these and you'll cultivate the outdoor ability to dish out flyer after flyer
> until one of them sticks.
> 
> Feel free to simulate this workout outdoors too, or tone things down indoors
> and ride either Big Mountain or Mount Cook, or ideally Roan High +4 since it
> includes a handful of sprints.

> undeniably damaging doses of training that comprise much of your loading
> weeks.
> 
> If you haven't yet learned the benefit of proper and adequate recovery, some
> hard lessons await you on the racecourse. If, however, you recognize the
> benefit of recovery done correctly, continue to treat your downtime with due
> respect as you work toward the peak fitness that lies just ahead.

### Sunday 

* **Name**: Springer Mountain
* **Duration**: 2 hours
* **TSS**: 103.0
* **NP**: 144
* **IF**: 72%

**Description**:

> Springer Mountain is 2 hours of Tempo intervals spent between 70-80% FTP with
> brief, intermittent, 1 to 3-minute recoveries at 55% FTP. This workout also
> includes 3x10-second Strength Sprints with 8-minute recoveries between each,
> and some Endurance Spinning intervals and some Single-Leg Focus drills are
> included as well.
> 
> Strength Sprints: Practice turning a big gear as forcefully as possible in
> order to recruit as many muscle fibers as you can. From a near stop and in the
> biggest gear you can gracefully turn over without exceeding 90rpm in 12
> pedalstrokes, stand and hold onto your handlebar drops while driving each foot
> down as hard as you can. Maintain excellent form and if you reach 90rpm inside
> of 12 pedalstrokes, choose a larger gear next time. **Note: When using a load-
> restricted trainer like a CompuTrainer or KICKR, consider switching to Slope
> Mode for your Strength Sprints.
> 
> Endurance Spinning: Practice spinning slightly quicker than your natural,
> self-selected cadence. Ride at a cadence that's at the very top of your
> comfortable rpm range and remain there for a solid 5 minutes. The goal is to
> learn to turn the pedals more quickly with less force (muscle stress) thereby
> improving your ability to remain predominantly aerobic over a wide range of
> rpm's. If your HR rises more than a few BPM, you're pedaling too quickly -
> take it easy and stay relaxed but quick.
> 
> Single-Leg Focus: The objective here is to learn to more effectively apply
> power through the entire pedalstroke by focusing strictly on one leg's
> activity through the bottom, upstroke, and over the top of the pedalstroke.
> For 90 seconds at a time, devote your attention to one leg before switching to
> the other. Your cadence may fall slightly, but these drills typically come
> more naturally to less experienced "one-leggers". Pay particular attention to
> lightly pulling your foot across the bottom, lifting your knee lightly upward
> and then softly kicking over the top of each pedalstroke. Add this drill
> indoors or outdoors as often as you like, more frequently if you recognize a
> significant difference in one leg's strength or coordination.

## Week 5

> Time to get back to work and hone each of your vital race capabilities to
> near-perfection while realizing some final, subtle improvements in overall
> fitness beginning with another round of Anaerobic repeats toward the very high
> end of the power spectrum. Based on what you may have learned in previous
> Anaerobic interval workouts, feel encouraged to make each of these relatively
> quick durations as productive as possible by tweaking the workout intensity
> such that you barely complete each painful effort.
> 
> Noodle away some of the ensured muscle heaviness the next day before moving
> onto a highly race-specific workout format: microbursts. Nothing simulates the
> on/off demands of crit racing quite like sets of short, super-high-intensity
> efforts coupled with extremely low-effort but equally short periods of active
> recovery. The dual-purpose here is to lift your anaerobic power capabilities
> while simultaneously elevating your aerobic capacity in a realistic and
> increasingly painful way.
> 
> After your usual Friday spin, the plan's fifth weekend begins with the first
> of two rigorous race simulations that are sure to be at least as demanding, if
> not more so, than your peak event(s). With a lap format based on a local-ish
> and highly esteemed NCNCA crit course, these repeats will challenge even the
> toughest, most race-ready crit racers and make you tougher and faster in the
> process.
> 
> Should you have any gas left in your tank come Sunday, log some time in the
> Sweet Spot and keep that muscle endurance on the upswing. In the event you'd
> rather ride longer but easier, try Town Hill or Maclure or head outdoors for a
> similar-TSS ride in the 60-70% FTP ballpark.

## Week 6

> Your final pre-taper week of training begins with your last Anaerobic power
> workout and what promises to push even the most anaerobically adept riders to
> the brink over the course of these high power sets. The recoveries are
> relatively lengthy, but it's likely that one power-duration combination will
> be tougher than the others; this is where you dig the deepest and achieve a
> new level of performance.
> 
> Ride off some of the dead-legs lethargy the next day and then it's onto a
> different but equally harsh version of last week's short/short affair. This
> week, the work intervals grow quite a bit, but their intensity comes down far
> enough to make the almost-too-short recovery valleys just barely sufficient.
> 
> After your end-of-week Endurance spine, your final full-volume weekend
> commences beginning with the grisly but reasonably true to reality Tour de Nez
> race simulation. Each of these simulations is demanding in its own way, but
> each conforms to the incessant and rigorous repetition faced in any technical
> criterium course making these race-based workouts highly useful in
> conditioning you physically and bracing you mentally.
> 
> If your legs are still up for a bit of work, a quintet of Sweet Spot repeats
> awaits. Should you decide to shift the focus from muscular endurance to
> aerobic endurance, substitute Ptarmigan +1 for a sizable drop in intensity or
> even Town Hill if you'd like to tone things down but ride more steadily. And
> as always, outdoor rides can be a welcome alternative to indoor training, and
> these simpler-structure rides lend themselves well to working in a less
> controlled environment.

## Week 8

> By week's end, you'll find yourself high on freshness, low on doubts and ready
> to exploit your peaked fitness. Heck, you might even be able to enjoy your
> races considering the capabilities you'll be bringing to the start line.
> 
> This week sees another round of training volume reductions, and if you feel
> like this isn't enough work to sustain your fitness, don't worry,  **it is**.
> Your aim  over these final two weeks was not to try to elevate your fitness
> but to uncover it by removing any last bit of fatigue that could limit your
> race performance, and this final week should do just that.
> 
> Saturday is an  _openers_  workout based on a Sunday crit, but if your race
> falls on Saturday or perhaps both weekend days, perform the short priming
> workout on Friday instead. If you'd prefer a different openers workout, take a
> look at Truuli -1 or find something similar in format and TSS.
> 
> If for some reason you aren't racing this weekend, it's a good idea to slot in
> a repeat of one of your criterium simulations in place of an outdoor race.
> 
> Beyond that, consider the work  **done**. Draw confidence from the fact that
> you’ve put forth all that’s necessary to have some great races, and  recognize
> that there’s absolutely no need to cram any last-minute sessions into your
> schedule - they'll only work against you. Get out there, have a great day, and
> good luck!
