# Trainer Road Plan: Cyclocross - High Volume

> The Cyclocross specialty plans will prepare you for the widely varied nature
> of 'cross racing by addressing the need for high-end sustainable power, the
> ability to generate high levels of force at very low cadences, and the
> development of repeated, high-power outputs following little if any recovery.  
> 
> Some cyclocross racers play things strategically, some exploit their technical
> finesse, and some capitalize on an outright willingness to suffer. However,
> all of them rely on a high level of wide-ranging fitness which is exactly the
> aim of our Cyclocross plans.

## Week 1

> Beginning with your final scheduled FTP assessment, you'll measure improvement
> garnered during your preceding Build plan in order to reestablish your power
> levels. Cyclocross being what it is, your Build plan may have been the Short
> Power, Sustained Power  **or**  the General Build training plan - such as the
> variability in cyclocross race strategies and tactics is.  
> 
> Post-assessment, your first evident shift toward anaerobic efforts will come
> via some sprints plunked into the tail end of what will usually be a midweek
> aerobic endurance ride. You'll then face what promises to be the first of many
> workouts aimed at peaking your ability to operate at a high level of your
> aerobic capacity. VO2max work is beneficial both in terms of its training
> adaptations as well as its similarity to the type of efforts required when
> racing on highly to mildly technical 'cross courses.
> 
> Following a short, end-of-week aerobic maintenance ride, you'll begin your
> weekend with the first weekly race-simulation workout. Composed of  _reduced
> amplitude Billats_ , these little honeys will find you going full-gas or
> attempting to recover at a level of effort well above typical recovery power
> output. But again, such is the nature of cyclocross racing.
> 
> You'll close out your first week of specialized training with some hard-start
> Sweet Spot repeats aimed at lifting your sprint power and then reinforcing
> your ability to sustain power near your FTP for long stretches. The initial
> small dose of sprint work aims to both awaken your fast-twitch fibers as well
> as simulate the hard-start explosiveness so often encountered in a race.
> 
> If you'd rather ride longer and slower on Sunday, try Town Hill or
> Grandfather, or head outdoors for a similar-TSS ride performed somewhere
> around 65%

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

### Sunday 

* **Name**: Torbert +2
* **Duration**: 2 hours
* **TSS**: 130.0
* **NP**: 162
* **IF**: 81%

**Description**:

> Torbert +2 is made up of 4x15-minute race-start intervals that each begin with
> a 30-second surge at 150% FTP and then quickly settles in at 90% FTP for the
> remaining 14 minutes.
> 
> Each interval is separated by 8 minutes of recovery.

## Week 2

> Week 2 sees the introduction of work dedicated solely to lifting your
> anaerobic power capabilities. This form of finishing work addresses your
> short-power capabilities by demanding possibly your highest indoor power
> outputs for very short durations. See these for what they are: brief but
> painful bursts of power that cultivate raw strength and lift your overall work
> capacity.
> 
> Your toned-down midweek butter-burner can be a great time to get outdoors and
> integrate some skills work into your lighter, aerobic riding. Just make sure
> not to overdo the effort level and come into tomorrow's high-intensity workout
> flat.
> 
> Speaking of which, this week you'll grow your VO2max interval duration by a
> slim but meaningful duration over last week's repeats. The goal here isn't to
> generate more watts but to hold high, supra-FTP power numbers for slightly
> longer durations thereby lifting your capabilities to lay down and  _sustain_
> high power output.
> 
> Following a short, fatigue-shedding aerobic ride, weekend 2 begins with a
> different and noticeably tougher round of race-simulating, high-power-recovery
> VO2max repeats. This is partly due to the minimal recovery between each
> muscular assault that moves you closer to the demands of mass-start racing on
> courses that funnel riders into fitness-contingent positioning. Put another
> way, only the strongest rise to the front of the field.
> 
> You'll close out this second week of specialized conditioning with a Sprint +
> Sweet Spot workout very similar to last week's, only this weekend the
> sustained segments grow in duration while still adding up to the same overall
> work duration.  
> 
> Prefer to keep things lighter and longer? Consider the same options as last
> week with Town Hill being the gentlest (and longest), Grandfather
> incorporating a handful of sprint efforts, or some outdoor mileage that
> ideally includes a bit of skill work.

> Each interval is separated by 12 minutes of recovery.

## Week 3

> Week 3’s first round of intervals focuses again on honing your ability to put
> down extremely high watts for very limited (but often pivotal) lengths of
> time. Whether you create big power with a fast spin, big gear, or very likely
> a bit of each, this capability doesn't appear magically for most of us. It
> takes a few weeks of work dedicated to cultivating a very specific and useful
> form of fitness.
> 
> Following your easy, midweek aerobic-maintenance spin - one where you'd do
> well to get outside and address some 'cross skills - your VO2max durations hit
> their peak. While you may have done longer repeats in other training phases,
> it's likely that your peak-aerobic-uptake power has never been higher than it
> is right now. So yes, you'll again grow the ever-important duration, but
> you'll do it at your highest level of work  _quality_  to date.
> 
> Then, noodle through an easy Endurance ride and move on to face some of your
> longest varied-length bouts of race-specific repeats. Use this as an
> opportunity to further familiarize yourself with the incessantly punishing
> nature of racing on the widest ranging terrain imaginable.
> 
> Week 3 then ends with what looks to be a repeat of week 1's Sweet Spot
> repeats, when in fact, the sustained segments take a few steps closer to your
> FTP. And yes, they still kick off with a 1.5x FTP sprint to further your
> ability to recruit a lot of muscle fiber all at once while also sending you
> into a long repeat with a little extra fatigue in your legs.  
> 
> Your longer/slower alternatives Big Mountain, Tenaya, or enough outdoor
> mileage to accumulate your target TSS while holding your power pretty close to
> 65% FTP.

> of short anaerobic bursts.
> 
> Rest assured you'll experience no decline in either your aerobic or anaerobic
> work capacity...unless you choose to fly in the face of endurance sports
> physiology and continue stressing a weary body.
> 
> If you are an athlete who's well versed in his/her recovery patterns though,
> feel free to tweak this recovery week's structure as you see fit. Just be sure
> to come into your final four weeks of training fresh, motivated, and fully
> prepared to realize your season's highest level of fitness.

## Week 5

> Following a bit of deloading that ideally finds you returning with a
> revitalized body and some renewed training motivation, it’s time to get even
> more specific with your final few weeks of training. This begins by coupling
> two previous workout types into a single format by adding an anaerobic burst
> of power to the beginning of your race-simulating VO2max repeats.
> 
> Then, the utility of your midweek aerobic maintenance ride has probably become
> apparent. The intention is to both facilitate recovery as well as maintain
> aerobic efficiency, but in some cases, the intensity is slightly too high for
> the intended recovery benefit. Even at fairly low power outputs, these short
> workouts can have a negative impact on the following day's high-intensity
> workout. If you've found this to be the case, either reduce intensity by
> 10-15% and focus solely on the restorative aspects of this training
> opportunity or skip the ride entirely and get a day of complete rest. Of
> course, skills work is still a recommended option.
> 
> Up next, what were once straightforward aerobic capacity repeats morph into
> ostensibly anaerobic repeats. But these short, intense intervals are so
> closely stacked that each subsequent repeat within a set grows increasingly
> aerobic in nature thereby making high demands - and reaping multiple training
> benefits - on both major metabolic systems. High power? Check. Repeatability?
> Check. Higher performance capabilities? Check.
> 
> Following another end-of-week opportunity for active recovery, aerobic
> maintenance, skill work, or perhaps a day off the bike, a new end-of-week
> interval format couples high-power starts with a returned focus on fortifying
> your muscular endurance as you lead into your most important events. Practice
> pushing hard and then settling into a pace that will drop most fools who try
> to follow your moves, all while you strengthen your ability to hold high
> percentages of your FTP for increasing durations.
> 
> Finally, some straightforward Sweet Spot work awaits. Having already done a
> healthy amount of anaerobic work and race simulation, these efforts focus
> solely on reinforcing your muscular endurance - or your aerobic endurance
> should you choose a longer, slower alternative like Big Mountain, Tenaya, or
> some mild but long outdoor equivalent.

## Week 6

> Week 6 begins with a near repeat of last week's race interval combo but with a
> slight increase in the intensity of your opening hard start as well as the
> high-intensity surges throughout each interval. Do your best to follow this
> high-force push with an increasingly smooth set of VO2max repeats. Even though
> it's virtually the same workout as last week, it doesn't have to be ridden the
> same way. Try to minimize any wasteful movement on the bike, any unnecessary
> muscle tension through your body, and any lack of control as each set
> progresses and your fatigue mounts.
> 
> Following another midweek aerobic-maintenance ride, you'll face what might at
> first appear to be a second repeat workout. This weeks' anaerobic-to-aerobic
> power repeats bump up the power demand, but the impact this seemingly minor
> change can have on a workout, race, and of course, your fitness, can be
> nothing short of tremendous, especially as the repeats stack up.
> 
> Following your Friday optional-at-this-point spin, your end-of-week
> combination workout kicks off with slightly more intense bursts of power
> before following the same format as last weekend. The overall stress of the
> workout barely changes, but the demands of each interval could rise
> substantially depending on where your 30-second power tops out. Use this
> information to inform later workouts and to refine your approach to actual
> race scenarios where a too-hard opening sprint can come at a far greater
> expense.
> 
> Close the week with another round of straightforward Sweet Spot repeats, or
> consider Tenaya, Lyell or some outdoor equivalent for a lighter-intensity,
> longer ride.

## Week 8

> During this final peak-fitness week, the training load drops to its lowest,
> maintenance-only point in the interest of leaving you eager, rested and
> excited to exploit your elevated fitness and high levels of performance
> confidence.
> 
> This week’s format can be repeated should you have a string of race weekends
> ahead since it maintains all the necessary intensity but not nearly as much of
> the fatigue-inducing volume. You can also substitute a race simulation the
> likes of Blue, Barren or Blood (or any of their variants) at the end of the
> week if it lacks a scheduled race.
> 
> The Saturday openers workout is meant to directly precede a Sunday race. If
> you're racing on Saturday or perhaps both weekend days, move this workout to
> Friday in place of Taku, or bypass it entirely if you perform well without a
> round of openers in your legs.
> 
> Finally, if you couple this final-week format with a weekly race or two, it's
> possible to maintain peak fitness for multiple weeks. Now go out there and
> reap the rewards of months of hard, consistent training the likes of which
> only the most dedicated and hardworking riders achieve.
