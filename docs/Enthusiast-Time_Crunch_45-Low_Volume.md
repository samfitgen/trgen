# Trainer Road Plan: Time Crunch 45 - Low Volume

> The Time Crunch 45 training plans still cater to time-limited training
> schedules but afford a little more stress and potentially a little more
> productivity. Again, riders on other plans can cherrypick shorter "30" or "45"
> -minute Time Crunch versions of their prescribed workouts when they find
> themselves a little short on time.
> 
> As can be expected, the warmups are short, the recoveries are brief and the
> cooldowns flash by pretty quickly. But the work intervals still retain the
> focus just like the longer versions of each Time Crunch workout. Then when you
> find yourself with a few extra minutes, your best bet is devoting that time to
> some extra warmup or you can simply tone down the intensity of the first
> interval/early few minutes when your time is limited to 45 minutes.
> 
> The low-volume version of the Time Crunch 45 training plan alternates one
> workout with 1-2 days off, 3 times each week. It follows the typical
> Tue/Thu/Sat schedule but can easily be shifted to a different schedule as long
> as you allow sufficient recovery between each short, intense workout; ideally
> 1 day minimum.
> 
> These plans lack scheduled recovery weeks and are not progressive in nature as
> their weekly training stress totals hover right around 180 TSS. The intensity
> of every workout is necessarily on the high side such that you can make the
> most of your limited training time, but there's no harm in toning down the
> Workout Intensity by 5-10% on those days where you're a little flat but still
> capable of some good quality effort.
> 
> With just over 2 hours on the bike each week, these plans aren't aimed at
> increasing your capabilities as much as maintaining them while challenging
> your heart & muscles briefly yet sufficiently on a regular basis thereby
> limiting any slips in fitness or undesirable changes in body composition
> (diet-dependent, of course).

## Week 1

> Right out of the gates, the first workout of your first week drops you right
> into a round of unforgiving VO2 Max repeats with minimal recovery time. But
> who needs to breathe anyway?
> 
> If you're coming into this block with no recent estimate of your on-the-bike
> fitness, swap this workout for the Ramp Test. Or if you prefer, either the 8
> Minute FTP Test or the 20 Minute FTP Test will work, and they'll be the only
> hour-long workout of this entire training block.  
> 
> Up next, arguably an even less forgiving interval format, your second workout
> of the week will address muscle endurance and good ol’ fashioned strength as
> you ascend a few rounds of power steps.
> 
> Finally, you’ll close your first week with a coach-favorite, a few "sprint-
> erval" repeats where you’ll prep your muscles with some preliminary sprints
> before targeting muscle endurance by holding your threshold power plus a few
> extra watts, but who’s counting?

## Week 2

> Week 2 kicks off with a mainstay of time-crunched training, high-intensity
> microbursts. These little marvels of misery alternate between all out & almost
> nothing while addressing more aspects of your fitness than you can imagine.
> 
> Your midweek workout consists of a slightly unusual take on over-unders but
> one that maintains the aim of improving your sustainable power by forcing you
> to work in close proximity to your FTP, whether slightly above or slightly
> below.
> 
> Finally, so as to round out this week’s muscle trauma trifecta, you’ll tackle
> some truly high-intensity efforts but with substantially more recovery time
> between them (relatively speaking of course) in order to boost your short
> power & unload any headspace baggage you’ve accumulated over the week thus
> far.

> 
> Recoveries following each interval are twice as long as the interval itself,
> i.e. 1:2 work to rest ratio, so recovery is adequate but not particularly
> restful.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 3

> Your third week introduces yet another new interval format with its first
> offering, strength ramps! Whether you choose to make them full-on "force
> ramps" or simply content yourself with less knee-threatening trips to some
> high-watt peaks, this one promises to wake up every available fiber you’re
> carting around in those well-muscled walking sticks under your hips.
> 
> And then it’s back to some time-crunched basics with a couple clusters of VO2
> Max repeats where we’ll eeease you into the world of oxygen deprivation with
> reasonably short 2-minute efforts.
> 
> This week closes with a round of tried & true over-under intervals to remind
> you how subtle an increase in effort it takes to flood your muscles when
> you’re riding that fine line between "not hard enough" & "too hard". Oh, and
> they’ll improve your lactate tolerance too.

> Time for a recovery week! Just kidding. No rest for the time-constrained,
> c’mon! Instead, you’ll kick off your week with a workout aptly named for both
> its dark nature as well as its highest of high intensities.
> 
> Up next, 4 grisly total-body assaults force you out of the saddle only to
> force you back into it for some increasingly demanding power output that only
> grows, all the way to the end.
> 
> And finally, we’ll lovingly dote on your trashed muscles with an almost-
> friendly version of one of our most brutal formats, team time trial repeats.

## Week 5

> Another week, another round of abuse. This one eases into things with what
> might be your "easiest" undertaking to date, 30-second Billats. But feel free
> to bump up the Workout Intensity a bit if you’ve grown accustomed to a certain
> level of suffering by now.
> 
> Then it’s onto some straightforward Threshold work where you won’t even exceed
> your FTP…except when you do. Because every minute you’re goaded into a short
> but all-out sprint to not only keep you awake, but more importantly, to keep
> your muscles crackling with an unrelenting eagerness to go fast!
> 
> Cap the week off with some race-simulation efforts that ask you to attack and
> attack... and attack (and rest occasionally) and you’ll be ready to tear the
> legs off any other rider training less than two hours a week - we promise.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 6

> Week 6 kicks off with a workout bent on helping you grow your aerobic
> capacity, nausea be damned! Another double set of VO2 Max repeats awaits but
> this time they build to their highest point before forcing you to cling to
> consciousness by reducing their demand perfectly in line with your brain’s
> minimum oxygen requirement.
> 
> What could possibly follow that act? Glad you asked, because your next
> challenge comes in the form of a straightforward little guy who isn’t high on
> flash but promises to sock you in the gut if you underestimate him. Work on
> growing your time at FTP with a few almost back-to-back Threshold repeats and
> elevate the watts a bit if you’re itchin’ to see if your FTP’s improved a
> little.
> 
> Finally, another repeat-ish performance where you’ll target your sustained
> power but liven things up with some short but serious muscle activating
> sprints every minute on the minute. After all, what’s a big FTP without the
> ability to openly & often display your brute strength?

> above your FTP, involves very little rest, and will leave you useless for a
> couple hours afterward - all in 45 minutes!
> 
> Then you’ll wrap up your time-crunched celebration of all that is painful with
> some efforts that are sure to make you feel as feeble as a newborn kitten
> today, and as fierce as a mighty, mighty lion…later. Extend your time to
> exhaustion by burying yourself in fatigue and then finding a way to continue

## Week 8

> And here we are, the end of the line, the final week in a line of many weeks
> and many tears. Save this week's tears though because your week begins with a

> workout. You’re welcome.
> 
> And then the fun really begins. Thank your lucky stars that you only have a
> 45-minute ride because any more than 6 of these tiny monsters and you’d likely
> be crippled - ride far enough above your FTP that your legs are already
> searing, get out of the saddle and sprint for a few seconds every 30 seconds
> then tell me you want more than 6 repeats.
> 
> And yes, we did save a bit of the best for last. Remember how painful those
> aerobic-capacity-boosting-cuss-at-the-bike, 2-minute VO2 Max repeats were? Who
