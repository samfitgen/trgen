# Trainer Road Plan: Full Distance Triathlon Base - Mid Volume

## Week 1

<pre>
_Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1900m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 10x25m CU
Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
between intervals; 10x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m
easy, RPE4.

_Tuesday_   **FTP Assessment**  Get a solid estimate of your current fitness
via the Ramp Test. You have the option of using the 8-minute FTP Test or the
20 Minute FTP Test if you prefer, just see to it that you reassess using the
same workout each time.

_Wednesday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 45min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
then conclude your run with 2x20s controlled sprints, RPE10, preferably uphill
w/ 40s of recovery between them.

_Thursday_ **Brick Workout (Cumberland + 20min Transition Run)** Very much in
line with the steady-state nature of a full distance triathlon’s bike leg,
you’ll work steadily for 45 minutes on the bike, in your aero position as
often as possible, before dismounting, transitioning quickly into your running
gear and hoofing it at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 for only 20 minutes of
heavy-leg running experience. Try not to let that initial lack of coordination
discourage you - it will pass before you know it.

_Friday_ **Ericsson** Time to target leg speed with the aim of improving your
pedal efficiency (or your ability to turn the pedals with the minimal amount
of effort and energy). You’ll work in a narrow but highly productive power
range that’s close enough to your FTP to get your mind and body ready for the
more rigorous workouts to follow in later training phases but not a range
that’s too taxing to prevent fairly rapid recovery.

_Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (1950m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 10x25m F
drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x150m of 50m Easy, RPE4/25m Hard, RPE8,
15s rest between intervals; 10x25m SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-
Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Saturday_ **Big Squaw** Steady mileage at a highly aerobic work rate is the
name of the game. Use these unrelenting, long stretches of time to pack some
fatigue into your slow-twitch fibers and grow their capabilities as a result.
By lifting your aerobic capacity, you’ll become capable of working at higher
percentages of your FTP while relying on less glycogen in the process - last
longer, go faster, burn less sugar.

_Saturday_ **Recovery Run** Run 25min Easy, RPE4 and insert 1-2 one-minute
walk-breaks if necessary.

_Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2000m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 1500m Easy-
Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4.

_Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run for 80min at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. The
goal here is steady, continuous mileage and a slower form of fatigue than
you’ll see during your shorter base runs. Accordingly, reduce the intensity to
4 or 5RPE if it keeps your legs turning over, non-stop and injury-free.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:
<pre>
The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
demanding, continuous effort.

The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
hang in there for as long as you can.

Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  

There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  

Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.

Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

<pre>
_Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2000m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 10x25m F
&T; Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 8x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
between intervals; 10x25m K&R; Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down
350m easy, RPE4.

_Tuesday_ **Berryessa** Time to build some capacity! In particular, strength.
By drilling it for a short 20 seconds at a time, your muscles will receive a
loud-and-clear request for for more - more muscle, more work, more power. This
is true, on-the-bike strength work that will not only lift your ability to
power the pedals for short durations but also much, much longer ones.

_Wednesday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 45min Easy-Moderate, RPE6, then
this week tack on a couple extra efforts by concluding your run with 4x20s
controlled sprints, RPE10, again preferably uphill w/ 40s of recovery between
them.

_Thursday_ **Tunnabora** While keeping your watts in a narrow and reasonably
high range, you’ll again target your ability to sustain a high percentage of
your FTP but this time you’ll also address how fluidly and quickly you turn
the pedals.

_Thursday_ **Base Run** Run 60min Easy-Moderate, RPE6.

_Friday_ **Tallac** Time for some steady-effort repeats in the Sweet Spot and
preferably in your aero position, at least for a few minutes at a time. Learn
to spend productive, on-Target durations in your low position while the effort
is manageably low and less likely to crush you under the combined weight of
aerodynamics and sustained riding power.

_Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (2100m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 10x25m CU
drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x150m of 50m Build from RPE4 to RPE8/25m
Descend from RPE8 to RPE4, 15s rest between intervals; 10x25m K drills w/ 15s
rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Saturday_ **Brick Workout (Cumberland + 20min Transition Run)** Just like
week 1’s brick, you’ll work very steadily for 60 minutes on the bike, in your
aero position as often as possible, dismount, transition quickly into your
running gear and run at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 for 20 minutes. This time,
try to be quicker in your transition and more evenly paced over the first 10
minutes of the run, not going out too hard.

_Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2100m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 1500m Easy-
Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4.

_Sunday_ **Base Run** 50min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Walk briefly when
necessary but try to grow your continuous running stretches a minute or two
each week. So if you ran for 10 minutes last week before walking for a minute,
try to run for 12 or 15 minutes before walking during next week’s base runs.

minutes before walking during next week’s base runs.
</pre>
## Week 3

<pre>
_Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2100m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 10x25m BB
Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 9x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
between intervals; 10x25m K &R; Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down
350m easy, RPE4.

_Tuesday_ **Fuji** If you managed to stay pretty consistent over last week’s 8
high-power repeats, add another this week and keep the power high and steady
throughout all 9 efforts. But if your power started falling off during the
later repeats, dial your effort down a little bit during the earlier 30-second
charges and try to finish as strongly as you start.

_Wednesday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 50min Easy-Moderate, RPE6, then
this time around, conclude your run with 6x20s controlled sprints, RPE10,
still ideally uphill, still with 40s of recovery between them.

_Thursday_ **Brick Workout (Phoenix + 30min Base Run)** Time to grow the
durations of each brick component by adding 15 more minutes of steady-state
riding to the bike segment and an additional 10 minutes of running to your
post-bike jaunt. See if you can get your transition a little more dialed this
week and develop the habit of shaving a few seconds each time you practice
this vital skill.

_Friday_ **Antelope** 50 total minutes of endurance work as you face a handful
of manageably long intervals aimed at increasing your sustainable power. The
recovery between each interval is pretty generous so extend the challenge a
bit by holding your aero position for as much of each interval as possible.

_Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (2100m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 10x25m FS
drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x150m of 50m Easy RPE4/25m Hard RPE8, 15s
rest between intervals; 10x25m SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down
350m easy, RPE4.

_Saturday_ **Town Hill** Steady mileage at a highly aerobic work rate is once
again the objective and steady hours of unrelenting, seemingly unending muscle
stress, light though it may be, will slow-cook your endurance fibers and grow
their capabilities over time. Keep it fairly easy, keep it long, and limit any
backpedal-breaks you might need to 10 seconds each.

_Saturday_ **Recovery Run** Run 30min Easy, RPE4. Nothing magical here, just
take it easy and listen to your body. Running slowly can be tough on the
joints, so if you feel some niggles in your joints, be smart and walk when
necessary or even cut this short run short.

_Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2200m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 1500m Easy-
Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run for 90min at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. The
goal here is still steady, continuous mileage and a slower form of fatigue
than you’ll see during your shorter base runs. If it’s been working for you,
reduce the intensity to 4 or 5RPEand keep your legs turning over non-stop. But
don’t lose sight of the fact that these long runs will eventually have to
match your intended run pace.

## Week 4 (Recovery)

<pre>
_Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1650m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 10x25m SC
Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
between intervals; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Tuesday_ **Haku** Your recovery week sees a reduction to fewer but no less
intense strength intervals. Maintain high, steady watts throughout each
20-second effort, even if that requires trimming this workout to 4 or 5
anaerobic repeats.

_Wednesday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 40min Easy-Moderate, RPE6;
conclude run with just 4x20s controlled sprints, RPE10, uphill or on flat
terrain w/ 40s of recovery between each.

_Thursday_ **Slide Mountain** Down at the lower end of the Sweet Spot range,
these 3 efforts will tone things down enough to keep your endurance in check
while allowing a little bit of recuperation this week.

_Thursday_ **Base Run** Run 35min Easy-Moderate, RPE6.

_Friday_ **Table Rock** A couple of longer repeats at the lower end of the
Sweet Spot power range are a good opportunity to target your time down low,
but if the fatigue is still heavy at this point in your first recovery week,
sit upright and even consider dropping the intensity 5-10%.

_Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (1700m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 10x25m BB
drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x150m of 50m Build from RPE4 to RPE8/25m
Descend from RPE8 to RPE4, 15s rest between intervals; Cool-Down 350m easy,
RPE4.

_Saturday_ **Brick Workout (Cumberland + 20min Transition Run)** Both bike and
run durations dip slightly this week but even recovery weeks are good weeks to
condition your body and mind to accommodate the discomfort of bike-run stress
and to practice your transition skills.

_Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (1800m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 1200m Easy-
Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4.

_Sunday_ **Base Run** 55min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6, and due to the
recovery nature of this week’s workouts, you’re welcome to take 1 to 2-minute
walk-breaks as often as necessary over the course of this run.

## Week 5

<pre>
_Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals + Sprints (2450m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
10x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 10x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
rest between intervals; 5x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest between
sprints; 10x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
RPE4.

_Tuesday_ **Bird -1** Time to work on developing some high-end power as you
target both leg speed and leg strength for one intense minute at a time. Think
of VO2max work as pulling your power up from the top while the later Sweet
Spot workouts push your endurance up from the bottom.

_Wednesday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Run 45min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
randomly insert 6x30s bursts of high speed, RPE9 over the course of the run
with at least 1 minute of recovery between bursts.

_Thursday_ **Brick Workout (Phoenix + 30min Base Run)** A repeat of Week 3’s
combo workout, try to improve on some aspect of each element of your brick.
Maybe make the bike slightly faster or spend more time down low, use a mildly
quicker spin perhaps. Then make your transition flow a little more smoothly
before ironing out some aspect of your run technique or pacing over the
30-minute, Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 run.

_Friday_ **Glassy** These 4 intervals will undulate between modest and mildly
challenging levels of effort while splitting a focus between aerobic
improvements as well as muscular ones. So ideally, you’ll improve your ability
to burn fat for fuel and pull more oxygen from your bloodstream while you also
derive some improvements in your higher-end, more muscle-based endurance.

_Friday_ **Swim Speed + Sprint Intervals (2450m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
10x25m HCU drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x200m of 50m Easy, RPE4/50m
Hard, RPE8, 15s rest between intervals; 10x25m Sprints, RPE10, 20s rest
between sprints; 10x25m K &R; drills w/15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m
easy, RPE4.

_Saturday_ **Allegheny** Steady mileage at a predominantly aerobic work rate
is yet again the priority and steady hours of low-level, super consistent
muscle stress is aimed at cooking your endurance fibers in order to eventually
grow their capabilities. Still try to limit any backpedal-breaks to 10 seconds
each.

_Saturday_ **Recovery Run** Run 30min Easy, RPE4.

_Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2500m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 1800m Easy-
Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run for 1hr 40min at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6.
The goal here is again that steady, continuous mileage and the associated slow
form of fatigue that comes with it. This is also where you continue building
the oh-so important belief that you can wrong long without falling apart.

## Week 6

<pre>
_Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals + Sprints (2600m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
10x25m F &T; Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 11x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/
5s rest between intervals; 6x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest between
sprints; 10x25m SK Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
RPE4.

_Tuesday_ **Mills** Still targeting high-end power via increased leg speed and
strength, this week’s VO2max offering extends the interval duration to 2
minutes each. If this requires a drop in the intensity, try these intervals as
low as 110% FTP and then see if you can increase that percentage over the
course of the workout. Maybe you can, maybe 110% is hard enough; in either
case, use these intervals to grow your ability to withstand short-term pain as
you increase your aerobic power.

_Wednesday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Run 50min Easy-Moderate, RPE6, then
this week sprinkle in 6x30s bursts of high speed, RPE9 over the course of your
run, at least 1 minute of recovery between bursts.

_Thursday_ **Looking Glass** These 3 intervals also undulate between modest
and mildly challenging levels of effort while splitting a focus between
aerobic improvements as well as muscular ones, they just do it fewer times but
over longer durations. As can be expected, they’re still about improving your
ability to burn fat for fuel and pull more oxygen from your bloodstream as
well as increasing your more muscle-based endurance.

_Thursday_ **Base Run** Run 45min Easy-Moderate, RPE6.

_Friday_ **Tray Mountain** How’s a little 3x20 Sweet Spot workout sound for
your midweek ride? How’s spending at least half of each interval in your aero
position sound? How’s 20 minutes of continuous pedaling, 3 times in a row
sound? It all sounds great if eventually sailing through 112 miles on the bike
and setting a new PR in the process is on your agenda. Get after it.

_Friday_ **Swim Speed + Sprint Intervals (2500m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
10x25m FS drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x200m of 50m Build from RPE4 to
RPE8/50m Descend from RPE8 to RPE4, 20s rest between intervals; 12x25m
Sprints, RPE10, 20s rest between sprints; 10x25m K drills w/15s rest between
drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Saturday_ **Brick Workout (Phoenix + 30min Base Run)** One more repeat of
this particular combo workout, and one more opportunity to improve on some
aspect of each element of your brick. Slightly faster bike? More time down
low? Mildly quicker spin perhaps? Then once more, try to make your transition
flow a little more smoothly before improving some aspect of your run technique
or pacing over the 30-minute, Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 run.

_Sunday_ **Swim Time Trial (2250m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 1650m Moderate-
Hard, RPE8; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4. Shoot for a pace that’s more in line
with your goal race pace, and if at all possible, try doing this swim in open
water (and wearing a wetsuit if you plan to race in one).

_Sunday_ **Base Run** 50min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Practice steady,
fluid running, entirely continuous if you can do it without sacrificing form.

_Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals + Sprints (2650m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
10x25m CS Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 11x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
rest between intervals; 7x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest between
sprints; 10x25m K &R; Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
RPE4.

_Tuesday_ **Dade -1** Last week you showed yourself you could gut it out for 2
minutes at a time, over and over again. This week you’ll step things up only
slightly by holding steadier watts well above FTP, all in the interest of
expanding your ability to process more oxygen, pump more blood, and do both at
a lower heart rate over time. Put another way, you’re strengthening your heart
and your muscles and raising your capacity for good, old-fashioned work.

_Wednesday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Run 50min Easy-Moderate, RPE6, then
randomly insert 8x30s bursts of high speed, RPE9 over the course of week 7’s
first run of the week with at least a minute’s normal running pace between
bursts.

_Thursday_ **Brick Workout (Gibraltar + 30min Base Run)** Bit of a bump in
this week’s bike segment of your weekly brick, but nothing different beyond
that. Keep the 30-minute run at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6, and try to shave
another few seconds off your bike/run transition.

_Friday_ **Spruce Knob** Treat each of these half-hour workouts as your one-
and-only effort of the day and don’t get ahead of yourself. Make each one
high-quality, mostly or entirely aero, and maybe even consider making those
small fit changes you’ve been considering between intervals if you want a good
side-by-side comparison.

_Friday_ **Swim Speed + Sprint Intervals (2700m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
10x25m HCU drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x200m of 50m Easy, RPE4/50m
Hard, RPE8, 20s rest between intervals; 12x25m Sprints, RPE10, 20s rest
between sprints; 10x25m SK drills w/15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m
easy, RPE4.

_Saturday_ **Appalachian** Continuing your aerobic endurance pursuit via the
more traditional, long-slow route, you’ll jump up another 15 minutes this time
around. Keep in mind that uninterrupted, indoor riding can be 1.2-1.8x as
effective as riding done outdoors making this 3.5-hour workout potentially
closer to 5 or 6 hours in training effect all depending on how infrequently
you let off the gas pedal.

_Saturday_ **Recovery Run** Run 30min Easy, RPE4.

_Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2700m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 2000m Easy-
Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run for 1hr50min at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6,
the goal again is steady, continuous mileage and that slower form of fatigue.
Reduce the intensity to 4 or 5RPE if it helps you keep running with minimal
walk-breaks.

**Description**:
<pre>
Run for 1hr50min at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6, the goal again is steady,
continuous mileage and that slower form of fatigue. Reduce the intensity to 4
or 5RPE if it helps you keep running with minimal walk-breaks.

## Week 8 (Recovery)

<pre>
_Tuesday_ **Swim Base Swim (2700m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 2000m Easy-
Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Tuesday_ **Bird -1** Remember when 1-minute repeats at 120% FTP were hard?
Before the days of 2-minute repeats? Well it’s time for a happy return to the
no longer ignorant bliss of short VO2max efforts as you retain your recent
gains via some shorter, kinder efforts.

_Wednesday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Run 45min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
randomly insert just 6x30s bursts of high speed during this second recovery
week, RPE9 over the course of your run, at least 1 minute of recovery running
between bursts.

_Thursday_ **Goddard** How about a little recovery week form work? With equal
emphasis split between furthering high-end base for later improvements in FTP
and technique work aimed at improving your pedaling efficiency, this workout
will expose any weaknesses in form while incorporating some short-duration
strength-endurance intervals that target your ability to sustain speed and
power to the pedals.

_Thursday_ **Base Run** Run 35min Easy-Moderate, RPE6.

_Friday_ **Slide Mountain** Down at the lower end of the Sweet Spot range,
these 3 efforts will tone things down enough to keep your endurance in check
while still allowing for some recovery to take place.

_Friday_ **Swim Speed + Sprint Intervals (2000m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
10x25m BB drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x150m of 50m Build from RPE4 to
RPE8/25m Descend from RPE8 to RPE4, 15s rest between intervals; 6x25m Sprints,
RPE10, 20s rest between sprints; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Saturday_ **Brick Workout (Cumberland + 30min Base Run)** Time for a near-
repeat performance of a similar, earlier brick, this time with perhaps a bit
more fitness but probably a bit more fatigue. So feel welcome to push the bike
leg a little harder this time or maybe back things off slightly, then keep
your short 30-minute base run at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 smoother, more
controlled.

_Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2000m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 1500m Easy-
Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4.

_Sunday_ **Base Run** 50min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Practice steady,
fluid running, and don’t hesitate to insert some 1 to 2-minute walking breaks
if your fatigue still hasn’t let you off its hook.

## Week 9

<pre>
_Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals + Sprints (2750m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
10x25m SA Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x200m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 10s
rest between intervals; 7x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest between
sprints; 10x25m K &R; Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
RPE4.

_Tuesday_ **Gemeni** 1 minute at 120% is tough but 2 minutes isn’t exactly
twice as tough. Use this knowledge as inspiration when you’re gutting out each
third minute of these merciless but highly productive repeats that help you
accumulate more time at/near your VO2max than any other workout to date. This,
in turn, yields perhaps the greatest central improvements (think: heart and
lungs) you’re likely to see at this early stage of training.

_Wednesday_ **Hill Repeats** 10min Warm-Up, Easy, RPE4; 8x1min all-out uphill
sprints on mildly steep, 4-6% grade, RPE10 with 2min of recovery jogging back
to the bottom of your hill, RPE2; 10min Cool-Down, RPE4 for roughly 45 minutes
of running.

_Thursday_ **Brick Workout (Phoenix + 20min Base Run)** Dialing things back
just a bit to get you back in the swing of things, you’ll ride steadily for 75
minutes, rising when necessary but staying aero as much as possible, then
dismount, transition expertly into your running gear and hoof it at an Easy-
Moderate pace, RPE6 for 20 minutes while you get clear of the riding fatigue
and establish a manageable pace as promptly as possible. Keep in mind that
it’s basically never sensible to jack your heart rate above the HR you sustain
at marathon pace. In other words, don’t go out too hard on the run.

_Friday_ **Eclipse** This round of 20-minute jobbers is pointedly aimed at
increasing your ability to work at high but sustainable levels of FTP as you
move your strength-endurance closer to those necessary for multiple,
continuous hours near this effort level.

_Friday_ **Swim Speed + Sprint Intervals (2700m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
10x25m CU drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x200m of 50m Easy, RPE4/50m
Hard, RPE8, 20s rest between intervals; 6x50m Sprints, RPE10, 20s rest between
sprints; 10x25m SK drills w/15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
RPE4.

_Saturday_ **Longfellow** One more bump in duration as you work toward your
final, longest ride. Try to keep the work as continuous as possible but
recognize when a 10-second backpedal can be the difference between
underproductive misery and a refreshed 30 minutes of aerobic base work.

_Saturday_ **Recovery Run** Run 35min Easy, RPE4.

_Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (3100m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 2400m Easy-
Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

rest between intervals; 9x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest between
sprints; 10x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
RPE4.

_Tuesday_ **Mist** Keeping in theme with last week’s VO2max brutality, this
week extends the challenge by a single interval. Perform these repeats at a
minimum of 110% with the intent of lasting the entire 3 minutes each time.
It’s not as important that these are done at any particular percentage of FTP
so much as it’s important that you accumulate as much time as possible at a
high level of your VO2max - work hard, breathe heavy, but don’t fade.

_Wednesday_ **Hill Repeats** 10min Warm-Up, Easy, RPE4, then all the way up to
10x1min all-out uphill sprints this week, on a mildly steep, 4-6% grade, RPE10
with 2 minutes of recovery jogging back down, RPE2; 10min Cool-Down, RPE4 for
about 50 total minutes of running.

_Thursday_ **Tray Mountain** One more crack at this one, and by now it’s
likely you’ve seen some improvement in your FTP. If you suspect that’s the
case and these intervals are feeling a bit under-challenging, bring your
intensity up 3-5% and see how things go. And don’t worry, you’ll soon have a
chance to assess these perceived improvements more formally during week 1 of
your build training.

_Thursday_ **Base Run** Run 50min Easy-Moderate, RPE6.

_Friday_ **Galena** Only slightly more intenst than Thursday’s workout, this
3x20 will again challenge your endurance capabilities over the course of 3
long efforts all aimed at improving your mental and physical stamina. Do your
best to keep the pedals turning forward for each long set and consider an
increase in intensity similar to any you might have applied on Thursday.

_Friday_ **Swim Speed + Sprint Intervals (2800m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
10x25m BS drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x200m of 50m Build from RPE4 to
RPE8/50m Descend from RPE8 to RPE4, 20s rest between intervals; 8x50m Sprints,
RPE10, 20s rest between sprints; 10x25m K &R; drills w/15s rest between
drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Saturday_ **Brick Workout (Polar Bear + 10min Transition Run)** Your longest
brick yet, at least on the riding side of things, will have you ride steadily
for 1 hour and 45 minutes, aero as much as possible, before capping things off
with a super short, probably eye-opening 10-minute, Easy-Moderate transition
run at RPE6.

_Sunday_ **Swim Base Swim (3300m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 2600m Easy-
Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Sunday_ **Base Run** 55min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Chances are, you can
use a lighter run today. You’re welcome.

## Week 11

<pre>
_Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals + Sprints (2800m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
10x25m F &T Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x200m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/
10s rest between intervals; 12x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest between
sprints; 10x25m SK Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
RPE4.

_Tuesday_ **Alice** Time for the grandaddy of 90-minute VO2max workouts. But
don 't worry, you're ready for this. Put your experience to use and modify the
intensity as necessary keeping "time at intensity" near the top of your
priorities, second only to proper pedaling form. If a 5 or 10% reduction in
power means you can keep the pedals turning at a reasonably quick cadence for
3 full minutes at a time, barely hanging in there, breathing at the height of
your controllable ability, then drop your watts as necessary - nothing lower
than 110% though.

_Wednesday_ **Hill Repeats** 10min Warm-Up, Easy, RPE4, then a whopping
12x1min all-out uphill sprints on mildly steep, 4-6% grade, RPE10 with that
same 2 minutes of recovery jogging back down the hill, RPE2, after each. Cool
down for 10 minutes, RPE4, and wrap up this hour-ish workout.

_Thursday_ **Brick Workout (Gibraltar + 30min Race-Pace Run)** Here 's the big
one, the most demanding brick you'll face over the entire course of your base
training. Start with a solid 90 minutes of power right in the race-pace
ballpark (probably a bit higher in many cases) before transitioning into a
30-minute run as close to race pace as possible.

_Friday_ **Spruce Knob** Once more, treat each of these half-hour workouts as
your one-and-only effort of the day and don 't get ahead of yourself. Make
each one high-quality, probably entirely aero at this point, and try not to
let off the gas for even a single 10-second backpedal break.

_Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (2800m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 10x25m HCU
drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x200m of 50m Easy, RPE4/50m Hard, RPE8,
20s rest between intervals; 8x50m Sprints, RPE10, 20s rest between sprints;
10x25m K drills w/15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Saturday_ **Putuo** One final bump in duration before we send you into this
plan 's last recovery week. Try to keep the work as continuous as possible but
give due credit to how much more productive you can remain by inserting the
occasional 10-second backpedal here and there.

_Saturday_ **Recovery Run** Run 35min Easy, RPE4.

_Sunday_ **Swim Time Trial (2531m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 1.2miles (1931m)
Easy-Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4. If possible, do this in open
water and wear a wetsuit if you plan to compete in one.

_Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run for 2 hours 10 minutes at an Easy-Moderate
pace, RPE6 and endure what promises to be the longest run of your 3-month base
plan. Adjust the intensity as necessary to last the entire 2 hours, and be
sensible in terms of occasional walk-break/aid station simulations that can go
a long way toward helping you retain your running form as the fatigue mounts.

rest between intervals; 5x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest between
sprints; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Tuesday_ **Bird -1** One last return to a VO2max format that is comparatively
easy. Keep your legs light and quick and bask in the forgiving nature of
intervals that end before the real suffering begins.

_Wednesday_ **Hill Repeats** 10min Warm-Up, Easy, RPE4 and then a drop to just
6x1min all-out uphill sprints on your mildly steep hill, RPE10 with a couple
minutes of of recovery jogging back to the bottom at RPE2; 10min Cool-Down,
RPE4 and only about 40 minutes of work today.

_Thursday_ **Seneca Rocks** Same goals of 1) time in the Sweet Spot to grow
your muscle endurance at reasonably high, sustained levels of power and 2)
integrating increasingly longer segments of time down in your aero riding
position, and this week, 3) a bit of recuperation owing the the kinder
interval formats.

_Thursday_ **Base Run** Run 40min Easy-Moderate, RPE6.

_Friday_ **Slide Mountain** Once more down at the lower end of the Sweet Spot
range, these 3 efforts will tone things down enough to keep your endurance in
check while still allowing for some much needed, hard-earned recovery to take
place.

_Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (2050m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 10x25m BB
drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x150m of 50m Build from RPE4 to RPE8/50m
Descend from RPE8 to RPE4, 15s rest between intervals; 8x25m Sprints, RPE10,
20s rest between sprints; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

_Saturday_ **Brick Workout (Gibraltar + 45min Race-Pace Run) OR Dans if racing
tomorrow** If you’re racing tomorrow, just get in a very easy 30 minutes on
the bike and call it a day. Not racing? Then tart with another solid 90
minutes of power close to or more likely a little above race pace before
transitioning into a Moderate-Hard, RPE8, 45-minute run as close to race pace
as possible.

_Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2200m) OR an Olympic Distance Triathlon**
Either warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 1500m Easy-Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 350m
easy, RPE4 OR compete in a C-priority practice race.
