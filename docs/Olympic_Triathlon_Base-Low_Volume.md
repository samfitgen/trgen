# Trainer Road Plan: Olympic Triathlon Base - Low Volume

> The low-volume version of the Olympic Triathlon Base plan has triathletes
> swimming twice each week for up to 3000m, on the bike twice each week for
> about 2.5 hours total (including a few brick workouts), and running less than
> 2 hours each week.
> 
> The central goal here is to provide time-constrained, Olympic-distance
> triathletes the necessary fitness to successfully complete a race at the
> international distance via sufficient base fitness in all 3 disciplines, all
> in the minimum amount of time - rarely more than 5 hours per week.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1100m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 6x25m CU
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 3x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 6x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 250m
> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday  _  **FTP Assessment**  Get a solid estimate of your current
> fitness via the Ramp Test. You have the option of using the 8-minute FTP Test
> or the 20 Minute FTP Test if you prefer, just see to it that you reassess
> using the same workout each time.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run** 35min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Feel free to insert
> 1 minute of walking whenever necessary as you try to run more continuously
> from week to week and emphasize quality over quantity at this early point in
> your running. Try to run for 5 minutes between walking breaks if possible.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (1200m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 6x25m F
> drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 4x100m of 25m Easy, RPE4/25m Hard, RPE8,
> 10s rest between intervals; 6x25m K drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-
> Down 250m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Goddard** With equal emphasis split between forming high-end base
> for later improvements in FTP and form work aimed at improving your pedaling
> efficiency, this workout will expose any weaknesses in form while introducing
> short-duration strength-endurance intervals that target your ability to
> sustain speed and power to the pedals.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 35min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Again, walk briefly
> when necessary if it means the difference between running well and sacrificing
> form while running efficiency suffers. Quick walking breaks of a single minute
> can often keep the form high while costing very little in terms of aerobic
> fitness improvements.

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Swim Base Intervals


**Description**:

> Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4 6x25m CU drills w/ 10s rest between drills 3x100m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals 6x25m K drills w/ 15s rest

### Wednesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> _Wednesday_ **Ericsson** Time to target leg speed with the aim of improving
> your pedal efficiency (or your ability to turn the pedals with the minimal

> around the Sweet Spot power range, but this time you'll see your longest
> intervals yet. If over the course of these longer efforts you find yourself
> underchallenged and you're recovering well between bike workouts, see how the
> tallest, third interval goes and then consider adding 2-3% to your FTP during
> later Sweet Spot workouts in order to determine if your FTP could use a little
