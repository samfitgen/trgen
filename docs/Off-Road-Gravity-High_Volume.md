# Trainer Road Plan: Gravity - High Volume

> Mountain biking's Gravity disciplines - Downhill, Enduro, Slalom/Four-Cross -
> lean heavily toward the high-power end of the endurance performance spectrum,
> but endurance is still very much a part of the picture. Maximal power output
> along with high-end aerobic and anaerobic conditioning comprises the bulk of
> each version of the Gravity Specialty training plans. Each plan also addresses
> the endurance fitness necessary to ride competitively in any of mountain bike
> racing's Gravity disciplines.

## Week 1

> In order to get a handle on any improvement gleaned from recent Build training
> or anything along those lines, week 1 begins with a Ramp Test that will help
> us update your FTP and anchor your power levels for the training ahead.
> Ideally, you'll have a day or two of recovery in your legs and will feel ready
> to fairly demonstrate your current level of fitness. If not, consider riding
> easy today and postponing your assessment until tomorrow.
> 
> Following a midweek Endurance ride, one that's a little longer than usual to
> compensate for the relatively low stress of yesterday's FTP assessment, you'll
> face your first iteration of a theme present in every week of this training
> plan: _hard-start_ intervals. Each Threshold interval in this workout kicks
> off with a short but highly intense sprint to familiarize your legs and brain
> with the effort necessary to sprint off the line, surge past a competitor, or
> sprint up an incline. Then you have to  stay on the gas for several more
> minutes just below your threshold power and shift your focus to building
> stamina at a high percentage of your FTP.
> 
> After an end-of-week spin, another opportunity to ride outdoors and target
> skills if you're not reeling from fatigue, the weekend begins with another
> recurring theme: reduced-recovery VO2max intervals. Each interval simulates
> race-day stress by forcing you to work well above your FTP long enough to load
> up your legs, then back off only as much as necessary to clear them before
> going again & again.
> 
> Then, this first week closes with a long round of Sweet Spot intervals
> interspersed with generous recovery valleys. These are aimed at furthering
> your ability to sustain a high but manageable level of effort for increasingly
> longer periods of time, and the unusually long recoveries aim to keep you a
> little fresher heading into each subsequent interval.  
> 
> You're welcome to keep things longer and lower-stress on Sunday via either
> Maclure or Town Hill. And you're equally encouraged to head outdoors for a
> ride that racks up similar workloads and includes similar efforts to those
> laid out within your training plan.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> With your assessment workout out of the way, it's time to breathe a bit more
> anaerobic/aerobic power into this plan using some short, intense intervals
> stacked so closely together that each subsequent repeat within a set grows
> increasingly aerobic in nature thereby making high demands - and yielding
> multiple training benefits - on both major metabolic systems. High power?
> Check. Repeatability? Check. Higher performance capabilities? Check.
> 
> Other than a couple more typically short Endurance rides, all remaining
> workouts repeat last week's demands and offer the chance to improve on each
> workout's execution. Do your best to make each interval even higher in quality
> than last week and leave you feeling as though you couldnâ€™t have done a better
> job.
> 
> A couple enhancements to expect are some harsher sprint demands on your
> weekday hard-start Threshold repeats, longer VO2max surges during your
> Saturday repeats, and longer Sweet Spot intervals on Sunday. In each case, the
> training load remains steady while the challenges within each workout grow
> noticeably.
> 
> Feel welcome to use the same Sunday alternatives as last week: an outdoors
> equivalent, preferably on sustained climbs, or Maclure or Town Hill indoors.

## Week 3

> In terms of performance metrics, your Tuesday repeats look no different than
> last weeks - same duration, same TSS, same IF. But a seemingly minuscule
> reduction in the intrainterval recoveries will make an increasingly noticeable
> impact on each subsequent anaerobic repeat and force you to dig a little
> deeper earlier in each set.
> 
> Following a midweek Endurance ride (a good time to get outdoors and work on
> your skills if you have the time), you're faced with your most aggressive pre-
> Threshold-interval sprints yet. Find out if a 30-second effort at 1.5x your
> FTP comes as a detriment to your post-sprint power output or instead serves to
> open a more substantial gap on any rider in your wake.
> 
> Following another short skills and/or Endurance ride, your first weekend
> interval session will raise the duration of every VO2max repeat to a
> consistently challenging length and draw out the workload as well as the
> benefit just a little further. This makes each VO2max repeat a little more
> difficult and opens your eyes to the effects a few extra seconds can have on
> _your_  muscles as well as those of your competitors.  
> 
> Finally, close things out with another round of Sweet Spot repeats, your
> longest of the plan. Or switch things up with some Sunday alternatives like
> riding outdoors on sustained climbs for a similar-TSS ride or stay indoors and
> endure the likes of Town Hill, Grandfather, or Ptarmigan +1.

## Week 5

> Following a bit of respite, itâ€™s time to exploit your refreshed muscles and
> perspective by jumping right back into some potentially more entertaining
> workout formats beginning with a foray into highly-focused anaerobic work via
> repeats far less concerned with any aerobic benefit than growing your ability
> to produce short, very high-energy bursts of power. This intent is reflected
> in the short durations, the super high intensities, and the relatively
> generous recovery intervals.  
> 
> Next, _spin_ _easy_ over the course of your midweek Endurance ride or head
> outside for some light riding coupled with a bit of skills work. Then, with
> the same dual goal of addressing aerobic and anaerobic capabilities within the
> confines of the same workout but also adding some less predictable variety
> into your hour of pain, the second workout of week 5 is a Coach Chad favorite
> that will throw a wide selection of efforts at you while keeping the
> recoveries as limited as possible.
> 
> Following another Endurance/Skills opportunity, the weekend starts with a bit
> of a mash-up where your hard-start efforts now precede several fairly short
> rounds of on/ _not-quite-off_  repeats. Each one of these sets could very
> closely mimic the demands of the shortest of short track races, and having 6
> in a row is likely to qualify as race-specific overload for most riders.
> 
> Finally, you'll close out this week with some extended and varied Sweet Spot
> work preceded by and concluded with a short flurry of all-out sprint efforts.
> Use these to simulate the early demands of any mass-start race where
> positioning for pivotal course segments can come down to a single explosive
> burst of power and then those late-race kicks that can decide the final
> rankings.
> 
> Longer/slower and outdoor alternatives are Big Mountain, Mount Cook or Tenaya,
> or an outdoor equivalent preferably including some time on the dirt.

## Week 6

> Week 6 begins with a deceivingly difficult assortment of only a few very high-
> power repeats that target your ability to generate maximum wattage for a small
> variety of short-term, overlapping, full-gas durations. The intent here is to
> raise raw work capacity rather than cultivate repeatability.
> 
> Up next is another short, midweek skills/Endurance session followed by one of
> Coach Chad's favorites that covers a lot of bases in a very narrow frame of
> time. Efforts ranging from high-Threshold to max aerobic with a heavy emphasis
> on repeatability and an apparent disdain for recovery will bury you in fatigue
> in a way only a mass-start race could rival.
> 
> After your second Endurance/Skills ride of the week, your sixth weekend begins
> with another foray into the world of hard-start, low-recovery VO2max intervals
> awaits and this week the opening sprint ratchets another step. For some
> riders, this will just be the next step in the progression toward higher
> performance. For others, this might signify a breaking point. The key is to
> determine what sort of initial burst of power exacts too costly a toll on the
> remainder of the repeats and what leaves just enough fuel in the muscles to
> back up that hard charge.
> 
> Your weekend wraps up with a workout very similar to last week's mixed bag of
> race-like efforts. Do your best to muster some solid sprint efforts early on
> as well as late in the game, in excess of the target watts  **if**  you feel
> up to the challenge, and then make the various steady-state efforts as smooth
> and seemingly effortless as possible. Look relaxed, be relaxed.  
> 
> Same lower-intensity or outdoor alternatives as usual: Grandfather, Town Hill,
> or long/easy to mid-duration/moderate-intensity trail time with similar TSS
> values.

## Week 7

> Your first taper week begins with a round of intervals focused on honing your
> ability to put down extremely high watts for very limited (but often pivotal)
> lengths of time. Whether you create big power with a fast spin, a big gear, or
> very likely a lot of each, this capability doesn't appear magically for most
> of us - it takes a few weeks of work dedicated to cultivating a very specific
> and useful form of fitness.  
> 
> Following your midweek spin is a pretty fun foray into a varied but purposeful
> mix of VO2max and Anaerobic repeats that will continue to ice your high-
> performance cake. You'll undoubtedly hit upon duration/intensity combinations
> in which you excel as well as ones that really beat you up. Use this
> information to inform your race strategies as well as future training
> manipulations.
> 
> After an optional end-of-week Skills/Endurance workout, you'll begin to close
> out your first week of taper training with one more round of Sprint + VO2max
> work that increases your initial sprint's intensity to its highest point. This
> assumes you haven't already exceeded this percentage of FTP in prior training
> having discovered a possible sprint aptitude. In any case, try for even higher
> watts this week knowing that any additional capacity derived from this final
> loading week is only going to serve you better on race day.
> 
> The weekend wraps up with another round of a now familiar combination workout.
> This week drops the workout's volume but leaves the intensity untouched.
> Ideally, this is enough of a reduction in workload to allow your muscles to
> begin their rebound in anticipation of your peak event(s).

## Week 8

> It's time to taper your training load with the goal of leaving you fresh and
> motivated by the weekend. You'll begin with a shorter round of Anaerobic
> capacity repeats that maintains all of the intensity necessary to keep you
> sharp but dispenses with a bit of the volume that leaves you heavily fatigued
> by the end of the workout.  
> 
> Your midweek spin becomes super easy and also optional - skip it if you're not
> feeling fully rested and recovered. Your VO2max repeats see a volume reduction
> as well, but they too retain all of the intensity necessary to keep you
> familiar with the pain but light on fatigue.
> 
> Saturday is an  _openers_  workout based on a Sunday race, but if your race
> falls on Saturday or perhaps both weekend days, perform the short priming
> workout on Friday instead. If you'd prefer a different openers workout, take a
> look at Scott Peak or the many versions of Truuli.  
> 
> This weekâ€™s format can be repeated should you have a string of race weekends
> ahead since it maintains all of the necessary intensity but not nearly as much
> of the fatigue-inducing volume. But donâ€™t plan to utilize this approach for
> more than a few weeks since peak fitness is a short-lived, temporary point in
> your ever-changing fitness.
> 
> Before that decline has any chance set in, go out there and reap the rewards
> of months of hard, consistent training the likes of which only the most
> dedicated and hard-working riders achieve.
