# Trainer Road Plan: Sprint Triathlon Base - Low Volume

> The low-volume version of the Sprint Triathlon Base plan has triathletes
> swimming twice each week for up to 2200m, on the bike twice each week for less
> than 2 hours total (including a couple brick workouts), and running up to 1
> hour each week.
> 
> The primary aim is to provide time-constrained, multisport athletes looking to
> successfully complete a sprint triathlon some base fitness in all 3
> disciplines in the minimum amount of time - 3.5 hours per week at the most.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (850m)** Warm-Up 200m Easy, RPE4; 4x25m CU
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 3x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **20 Minute Test** Get a solid estimate of your current fitness
> via a 20-minute time trial performed at your highest sustainable power. You
> have the option of using the 8-Minute Test if you prefer, due to the short,
> more intense nature of a Sprint Triâ€™s bike leg.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run** 25min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Feel free to insert
> 1 minute of walking whenever necessary as you try to run more continuously
> from week to week and emphasize quality over quantity at this early point in
> your running. Try to run for 5 minutes between walking breaks if possible.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Base Intervals (800m)** Warm-Up 200m Easy, RPE4; 4x25m FS
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 3x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Goddard -4** With equal emphasis split between forming high-end
> base for later improvements in FTP and form work aimed at improving your
> pedaling efficiency, this workout will expose any weaknesses in form while
> introducing short-duration strength-endurance intervals that target your
> ability to sustain speed and power to the pedals.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 25min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Again, walk briefly
> when necessary if it means the difference between running well and sacrificing
> form while running efficiency suffers. Quick walking breaks of a single minute
> can often keep the form high while costing very little in terms of aerobic
> fitness improvements.

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Base Intervals  


**Description**:

> Warm-Up 200m Easy, RPE4 4x25m CU drills w/ 10s rest between drills 3x100m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals Cool-Down 250m Easy, RPE4


### Wednesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!


### Thursday 

* **Name**: Base Run 
* **Duration**: 1 day and 1 hour


**Description**:

> 25min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Feel free to insert 1 minute of walking
> whenever necessary as you try to run more continuously from week to week and
> emphasize quality over quantity at this early point in your running. Try to
> run for 5 minutes between walking breaks if possible.

* **NP**: 158
* **IF**: 79%

**Description**:

> Goddard -4 is still dedicated to form work but this shorter version removes

> 
> You'll first face 10x30-second Form Sprints with 90 seconds of rest between
> each.
>

> recovery between them.


### Sunday 

* **Name**:  Base Run 
* **Duration**: 1 day and 1 hour


**Description**:

> 25min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Again, walk briefly when necessary if it

## Week 2

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1000m)** Warm-Up 200m Easy, RPE4; 4x25m F &T

> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Tunnabora -4** While keeping your watts in a narrow and
> reasonably high range, youâ€™ll again target both your ability to sustain a high
> percentage of your FTP while also addressing how fluidly and quickly you turn
> the pedals. This is where your ability to ride a little above your FTP for
> 20km/12mi begins.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run** 25min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Keep inserting
> 1-minute walking breaks as necessary but try to increase the steady run
> durations for a minute or 2 more this week, maybe 6 or 7 minutes each time.

> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Brick Workout (Monitor -4 + 10min Transition Run)** The bike
> workout is pretty straightforward in the way it lifts the Sweet Spot duration
> to 6 minutes at a time this week, trims the recoveries to a scant 2 minutes.
> Then, as quickly as possible, transition from the bike into your running gear
> and run at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 for only 10 minutes in order to get a
> feel for running directly off the bike, with a little bit of fatigue in your
> legs.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 25min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6, still walking briefly
> when necessary in order to retain your form and efficiency - think of running
> well rather than simply running continuously with deteriorating technique.

> 
> _Wednesday_ **Ericsson -4** Time to target leg speed with the aim of improving
> your pedal efficiency (or your ability to turn the pedals with the minimal
> amount of effort and energy). As usual, youâ€™ll work in that narrow, but highly
> productive power range. This will get you close enough to your FTP to get your
> mind and body ready for the more rigorous workouts to follow in later training
> phases, but it shouldn't be too taxing that it prevents fairly rapid recovery.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run** 30min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. As the overall run
> duration increases a little bit, keep adding 1-minute walking breaks as
> necessary as you grow your steady run durations another minute or two aiming

> _Saturday_ **Carson** More steady-effort repeats in the Sweet Spot power range
> and this week youâ€™ll see your longest (but only slightly longer than last
> weekâ€™s) intervals yet. If you find yourself underchallenged by these intervals
> and youâ€™re recovering well between bike workouts, consider adding 2-3% to your
> FTP during the latter 3 or 4 intervals in order to determine if your FTP could
> use a little adjustment. And make sure youâ€™re spending some time in the
> position youâ€™ll use on the road too - aero bars, clip-onâ€™s, drops; whatever
> youâ€™ll use come race day.

> if/when necessary to keep your form and efficiency at the front of your mind.
