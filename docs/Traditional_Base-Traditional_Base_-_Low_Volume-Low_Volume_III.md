# Trainer Road Plan: Traditional Base - Low Volume III

## Week 1

> The first week of Base III will again begin with an opportunity to assess
> changes in your sustainable power via the Ramp Test (or the 8 Minute FTP Test
> or 20 Minute FTP Test). Alternatively, you can perform Week 2's Tuesday
> workout in place of the FTP Assessment if you've already accounted for
> possible fitness improvements in another manner, but it's important that
> you've reassessed your FTP and adjusted your training levels accordingly.
> You'll then face your first Muscular Endurance (ME) ride comprised of some
> relatively short, multi-cadence Tempo intervals. Finally, your weekend rides
> consist of a sprint/Sweet Spot workout and the usual long Aerobic Endurance
> ride and the associated speed and efficiency drills but with the addition of a
> few Power Sprints.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

### Thursday 

* **Name**: Slide Mountain
* **Duration**: 1 hour
* **TSS**: 59.0
* **NP**: 154
* **IF**: 77%

**Description**:

> Slide Mountain is 3x10-minute intervals at 85% FTP with 4-minute recoveries
> between intervals.

### Saturday 

* **Name**: North Twin
* **Duration**: 1 hour
* **TSS**: 62.0
* **NP**: 158
* **IF**: 79%

**Description**:

> North Twin begins with 3x5-minute Tempo intervals between 60-85% FTP that each
> conclude with a 10-second sprint between 180-200% FTP.
> 
> The second part of North Twin consists of 25 minutes of Sweet Spot-ish work
> between 85-95% FTP with short bouts of aerobic Endurance riding at 55-75% FTP
> separating each interval.


### Sunday 

* **Name**: Hesperus
* **Duration**: 2 hours and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 119.0
* **NP**: 138
* **IF**: 69%

**Description**:

> Hesperus is nearly 2.5 hours of Tempo and aerobic Endurance spent between
> 60-85% FTP. It includes a round of Power Sprints early in the workout, and
> optional form drills include Endurance Spinning intervals and some Single-Leg
> Focus drills.
> 
> Power Sprints: These are the culmination of Form Sprints and Strength Sprints
> and teach you to overcome heavy resistance quickly. At a reasonable cadence,
> 85-95rpm, jump out-of-the-saddle and wind up a big gear but not as big as the
> gear used during previous Strength Sprints. These sprints are only 10s long
> and should allow you to get in a maximum of 24 pedalstrokes and reach a high
> rpm, 130rpm or higher. Practice winding up a lot of watts in the briefest time
> possible while maintaining the form and technique you picked up during
> previous Form Sprints. Experiment with which foot to lead with, and don't
> hesitate to practice leading with either.
> 
> Endurance Spinning: Practice spinning slightly quicker than your natural,
> self-selected cadence. Ride at a cadence that's at the very top of your
> comfortable rpm range and remain there for a solid 5 minutes. The goal is to
> learn to turn the pedals more quickly with less force (muscle stress) thereby
> improving your ability to remain predominantly aerobic over a wide range of
> rpm's. If your HR rises more than a few BPM, you're pedaling too quickly -
> take it easy and stay relaxed but quick.
> 
> Single-Leg Focus: The objective here is to learn to more effectively apply
> power through the entire pedalstroke by focusing strictly on one leg's
> activity through the bottom, upstroke, and over the top of the pedalstroke.
> For 90 seconds at a time, devote your attention to one leg before switching to
> the other. Your cadence may fall slightly, but these drills typically come
> more naturally to less experienced "one-leggers". Pay particular attention to
> lightly pulling your foot across the bottom, lifting your knee lightly upward
> and then softly kicking over the top of each pedalstroke. Add this drill
> indoors or outdoors as often as you like, more frequently if you recognize a
> substantial difference in one leg's strength or coordination.

## Week 2

> The second week of Base III will introduce you to some standing hill intervals
> which also vary your cadence and then a slight increase in your ME interval
> intensity finishes out the weekday workouts. Your first weekend ride includes
> increases in interval duration while Sunday's long ride is a repeat of last
> week's. After you've completed your sprint drills and begin working through
> the same drills you faced in Base I and II, focus on truly refining your
> pedalstroke fluidity and quality as your focus on efficiency will likely
> decline when you soon enter your advanced conditioning training phases.

## Week 3

> Week 3 of Base III builds your rides to the phase's highest levels of stress
> so far with another slight increase in interval duration and/or intensity
> across the board with the exception of Sunday's repeated long ride and drills.
> Again, make the most of your end-of-week sprint and efficiency drills and
> continue to improve your pedal economy and sprint capacity, even if you don't
> consider yourself a sprinter.

## Week 4

> As usual, Week 4 of Base III will cut the workload down to its lowest point
> and allow your body to absorb the stress of the preceding 3 weeks. You only
> need to ride 3 times this week, as you're given an extra day of rest on
> Saturday. Feel free to add a short Active Recovery ride (Recess 60) if you
> feel it won't affect next week's freshness. You'll still be integrating some
> efficiency drills and lighter-intensity sprint drills during your single
> weekend ride. This will keep you on track, but allow you the opportunity to
> soak up the training stress while refreshing your tired muscles and equally
> taxed mind.
