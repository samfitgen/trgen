# Trainer Road Plan: Traditional Base - High Volume III

> The high-volume version of the Traditional Base III training phase will have
> you on the bike 6 times each week for somewhere between 1 to 4 hours with
> Recovery Week rides ranging from 1.5 to 2 hours.
> 
> The goals of this training phase expand to include a greater focus on muscular
> endurance as we focus on turning bigger gears for growing durations by
> simulating longer climbs, both in & out of the saddle, as well as more
> straightforward strength endurance work. We'll also combine the attributes of
> previous sprint drills - speed & force - into sprint drills which target rapid
> acceleration, i.e. power. We'll continue the development of your aerobic
> endurance by reaching the longest AE ride durations of the Traditional Base
> training plans, and we'll continue to practice the Base I & II efficiency
> drills.
> 
> Again, riders focused on improving their time trial performance should
> consider extending this training phase by 1 week for a total of 5 weeks and
> ultra-endurance riders should again consider extending this phase by an extra
> 2 weeks for a total of 6 weeks.

## Week 1

> The first week of Base III will start with an opportunity to assess changes in
> your sustainable power via the Ramp Test. As always, you're free to use either
> the 8 Minute FTP Test or the 20 Minute FTP Test instead. Alternatively, you
> can perform Week 2's Tuesday workout in place of the FTP Assessment if you've
> already accounted for possible fitness improvements in another manner, but
> it's important that you've reassessed your FTP and adjusted your training
> levels accordingly. You'll then face a midweek long ride which includes a few
> power sprints followed by your first Muscular Endurance (ME) ride comprised of
> some relatively short, multi-cadence Tempo intervals. Following a relatively
> short Aerobic Endurance ride, your weekend rides consist of a sprint/Sweet
> Spot workout and the usual long Aerobic Endurance ride and the associated
> speed and efficiency drills and a few Form Sprints.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!


### Wednesday 

* **Name**: Flattop
* **Duration**: 3 hours
* **TSS**: 130.0
* **NP**: 132
* **IF**: 66%

**Description**:

> Flattop is 3 hours of Aerobic Endurance spent almost entirely between 60-70%
> FTP including an early round of Power Sprints. Form drills include Endurance
> Spinning intervals and some Isolated Leg Training drills.
> 
> Power Sprints: These are the culmination of Form Sprints and Strength Sprints
> and teach you to overcome heavy resistance quickly. At a reasonable cadence,
> 85-95rpm, jump out-of-the-saddle and wind up a big gear but not as big as the
> gear used during previous Strength Sprints. These sprints are only 10s long
> and should allow you to get in a maximum of 24 pedalstrokes and reach a high
> rpm, 130rpm or higher. Practice winding up a lot of watts in the briefest time
> possible while maintaining the form and technique you picked up during
> previous Form Sprints. Experiment with which foot to lead with, and don't
> hesitate to practice leading with either.
> 
> Endurance Spinning: Practice spinning slightly quicker than your natural,
> self-selected cadence. Ride at a cadence that's at the very top of your
> comfortable rpm range and remain there for a solid 5 minutes. The goal is to
> learn to turn the pedals more quickly with less force (muscle stress) thereby
> improving your ability to remain predominantly aerobic over a wide range of
> rpm's. If your HR rises more than a few BPM, you're pedaling too quickly -
> take it easy and stay relaxed but quick.
> 
> Isolated Leg Training (One-Leggers): Like Single-Leg Focus drills, the
> objective here is to learn to more effectively apply power through the entire
> pedalstroke by focusing strictly on one leg's activity through the bottom,
> upstroke, and over the top of the pedalstroke. Completely unclip one foot from
> the pedal and rest it on your trainer, a stool, or anything that allows it to
> safely rest without interfering with your other leg's pedaling. Begin with
> slow cadence - very slow in some cases - and periods of 10-20s per leg unless
> you can pedal longer without "knocking" and don't worry about your temporarily
> low power, these drills aren't about strength. As you improve, your cadence
> will increase as will each leg's duration. Pay close attention your kick and
> pull thinking more in terms of horizontal/back and forth pedaling especially
> if you begin feeling deadspots in your pedalstroke or you begin hearing a
> knocking sound due to those deadspots. Keep tension on the chain and switch
> anytime your form degrades; don't practice bad habits just to tack on 5 or 10
> more seconds. Include this drill indoors 2-3 times each week accumulating 5-10
> minutes per leg each workout.

## Week 2

> The second week of Base III will introduce you to some standing hill intervals
> which also vary your cadence. Following a repeat of last Wednesday's long
> ride, you'll face a slight increase in your ME interval intensity and the same
> AE ride will finish out the weekday workouts. Your first weekend ride includes
> increases in interval duration while Sunday's long ride grows the overall
> duration a bit. After you've completed your sprint drills and begin working
> through the same drills you faced in Base I and II, focus on truly refining
> your pedalstroke fluidity and quality. Your focus on efficiency will likely
> decline when you soon enter your advanced conditioning training phases.

> 
> Pistons: Few if any riders need to practice pushing down on the pedals, but
> improvements in how well your knees move are both beneficial to economy and
> joint health. As you pedal, pay close attention to how your knees track. They
> should move directly up, directly down - like pistons - with little if any
> lateral movement, especially at the top of each pedalstroke. Focus on one knee
> for 30s before switching sides.
> 
> Kick & Pull: A balanced pedalstroke is dependent upon consistent tension on
> your bike's drivetrain throughout the entire pedalstroke. Reinforce your
> ability to maintain tension through the weakest portions of the pedalstroke,
> the top & bottom quadrants. As your knee approaches top-dead-center, lightly
> kick your toes into the fronts of your shoes, and as your feet approach
> bottom-dead-center, lightly pull your heels into the backs of your shoes -
> kick & pull. Focus on just the kick for 30s, just the pull for 30s, then
> eventually both for 30s simultaneously.
> 
> Single-Leg Focus: The objective here is to learn to more effectively apply
> power through the entire pedalstroke by focusing strictly on one leg's
> activity through the bottom, upstroke, & over the top of the pedalstroke. For
> 90 seconds at a time, devote your attention to one leg before switching to the
> other. Your cadence may fall slightly, but these drills typically come more
> naturally to less experienced "one-leggers". Pay particular attention to
> lightly pulling your foot across the bottom, lifting your knee lightly upward
> & then softly kicking over the top of each pedalstroke. Add this drill indoors
> or outdoors as often as you like, more frequently if you recognize a
> substantial difference in one leg's strength or coordination.

## Week 4

> Friday. Feel free to add a short Active Recovery ride (Recess 60) if you feel
> that it won't affect next week's freshness. You'll still be integrating some
> efficiency drills and lighter-intensity sprint drills during your weekend
> rides in order to keep you on track. This will allow you the opportunity to
> soak up the training stress while refreshing your tired muscles and equally
