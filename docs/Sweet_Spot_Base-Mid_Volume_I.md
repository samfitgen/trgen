# Trainer Road Plan: Sweet Spot Base - Mid Volume I

## Week 1

<pre>
This first week is dedicated to assessing your current fitness, familiarizing
you with the Sweet Spot intensity level, and opening your eyes to the magical
world of over-unders.
</pre>

### Monday 

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:
<pre>
The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
demanding, continuous effort.

The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
hang in there for as long as you can.

Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  

There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  

Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.

Good luck, ride hard!

</pre>
## Week 2

<pre>
Leg speed and muscle endurance get equal billing in your week's first workout.
Learn to pedal quickly with as little wasted energy as possible before
fostering a little more fat-burning capability during a short, easy midweek
spin.

Then you'll face a round of continuous Sweet Spot intervals where the
intervals fold directly into one another with no scheduled recovery thereby
escalating the muscle endurance challenge in an effort to continue growing
your ability to work at near-FTP power outputs for extended durations.

Your weekend cements the over-under/Sweet Spot interval combination, one
you'll face every weekend for the entirety of this month of training.
