# Trainer Road Plan: Sweet Spot Base - Low Volume II

> The Sweet Spot Base plans are foundation training plans that can serve as the
> basis for all training tracks offered by TrainerRoad.
> 
> The low-volume version of Sweet Spot Base II builds rather substantially on
> the preceding Base I plan in terms of workout types but only marginally
> increases the stress from week to week all in the hopes of gradually
> progressing your fitness and raising the training benefit that comes with
> high-intensity intervals.
> 
> Over the course of this 6-week training plan, you'll have opportunities to
> face and conquer everything from long aerobic Endurance rides to high-
> intensity VO2max intervals and everything in between.

## Week 1

> Week 1 is a smattering of the old blended with an interesting assortment of
> the new. Following your reassessment to account for any improvement acquired
> during Sweet Spot Base I, you'll square off against one of only a couple of
> Sweet Spot workouts. But these otherwise familiar intervals include some brief
> surprises in the form of short but intense, sprint-like bursts. The week then
> closes out with an introduction to Threshold intervals which will push you
> right up to your FTP and teach you how to stay there.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

Rest Day

## Week 2

> Week 2 kicks off with an entirely new brand of pain in the form of tried and
> true, high-intensity VO2max repeats. Lucky for you, these are of the 'short-
> short' variety and even though they'll coax out a very high level of oxygen
> uptake, they'll do it in a manner arguably more friendly than the longer
> efforts you'll face in your Build training.
> 
> Next, you'll face another round of near-FTP Threshold repeats just before your
> week draws to a close with a round of Sweet Spot repeats that each begin with
> a short burst of raw power.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 3

> Week 3 is a blend of VO2max intervals, Threshold work, and an introduction
> into the downright masochistic world of power steps.
> 
> Having conquered 30-second VO2max repeats last week, this week doubles the
> sustained duration of each repeat. But don't worry because there are far less
> of them thus only modestly lifting the workout's overall training stress. This
> is the next stepping stone in your endeavors to eventually dole out power
> outputs like these for substantially longer stretches or simply get very good
> at repeating shorter, more intense repeats without fading.
> 
> Then, you'll move to your next familiar yet fresh workout format, Threshold
> intervals with some more sprint-like bursts scattered throughout.
> 
> Finally, you'll finish off your training week with a repeat workout of some
> always painful over-unders.

## Week 4

> Week 4 is another well varied, cover-all-bases assortment of workouts that
> lends itself to furthering a number of riding capabilities.
> 
> In what may seem like an unreasonable jump up from 1-minute VO2max intervals,
> this week once again doubles each interval's duration. Fortunately, the
> efforts themselves are of the 'peak & fade' nature. This interval design
> allows you to initially achieve a high oxygen uptake and then tone down the
> power (and pain) while your cardiovascular stress remains high, high, high.
> 
> Then, bask in the VO2max afterglow as you undertake a quiet beast of a
> Threshold workout made even more challenging with an optional emphasis on
> determining your power/aero balance.  
> 
> Finally, you'll face some unforgiving steps up to and briefly beyond your FTP.
> Practice riding through the pain without ever indulging the temptation to bail
> out.

## Week 5

> Week 5 is one more well varied, cover-all-bases assortment of workouts that
> lends itself to furthering a number of riding capabilities.
> 
> Last week's VO2max repeats started at high power then dropped while this
> week's holds them steadily high. Added to that, these stay up high for 3 full
> minutes each. But don't worry, the recovery valleys are a bit longer than
> usual and more importantly, you're ready for this.  
> 
> Up next is a workout that affords a bit of flexibility depending on your rate
> of recovery. If you're tired, dial things down to Sweet Spot with a 10-15%
> reduction in Workout Intensity. Just a little off your game? Try a 5% drop and
> stay just below your FTP today. Feeling fresh and ready to see just how
> "functional" your FTP truly is? Then feel free to see how 40 very steady
> minutes at hour-power, indoors, actually feels.
> 
> Finally, your week is capped off with yet another twist on over-under
> intervals in the form of mildly varied under-segments, and short but equally
> varied over-segments.
