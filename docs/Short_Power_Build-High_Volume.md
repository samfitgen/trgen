# Trainer Road Plan: Short Power Build - High Volume

> Building on the hard-earned base conditioning you've recently established,
> it's time to move toward increasingly specific forms of training stress in
> order to better prepare you for your specific events as well as the even more
> event-specific training to follow.
> 
> Even a short-power rider maintains a heavy reliance on longer, sustained
> power. Accordingly, a toned-down emphasis on strength endurance will still
> find its way into this Short Power Build plan but increased attention will
> fall on improving your ability to operate at high percentages of your VO2max
> power as well as your ability to throw down big watts for very short
> durations, repeatedly, and often with minimal recovery time.  
> 
> So riders concentrating on improving their abilities as shorter-course
> mountain bikers, cyclocross racers, criterium specialists even road racers
> facing courses with plenty of punchy variety will find this Build plan a
> proper match for their dynamic riding style. This training will further your
> ability to race aggressively, react quickly and powerfully, and do so again
> and again with minimal or no decline in performance.

## Week 1

> As is typical of most of our training plans' first week, Week 1 offers your
> first crack at assessing any fitness improvements reaped from your former
> base-training efforts via our Ramp Test. And though this is our preferred FTP
> assessment protocol, you're welcome to substitute either the 8 Minute FTP Test
> or the 20 Minute FTP Test if that's your preferred assessment format.
> 
> Following a midweek aerobic ride sprinkled with a few sprints, you'll face the
> challenge of some race-like repeats where you'll operate way up at VO2max
> wattage and recuperate somewhere in the Sweet Spot before doing it again and
> again in order to simultaneously build big aerobic and anaerobic work
> capacities.
> 
> After a short and ideally easy Friday spin, one you can skip anytime the
> fatigue is alarmingly high heading into your weekend, you'll face a recurring,
> useful weekend blend that begins with hard-start, strength endurance intervals
> that spice your high-end endurance work with mean little sprints at the outset
> of each interval.
> 
> The second of half of your weekend combination is some straightforward Sweet
> Spot intervals to keep those oh-so-necessary subthreshold capabilities on the
> rise. If you'd rather do something longer and slower instead, consider
> Grandfather if you'd like to throw a few sprints into the mix, or ride Town
> Hill for some steadier, sprint-less effort.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> Week 2 begins with some VO2max work preceding an extended segment of aerobic
> Endurance riding tacked on to the end in order to keep tomorrow's short and
> easy ride _actually_ pretty short and easy. Closely stacked VO2max repeats aim
> to challenge both your ability to perform seemingly anaerobic efforts at high
> wattage, but just as importantly, they'll task your aerobic engine more and
> more as the closely-set intervals progress.
> 
> Following the previously mentioned Endurance ride that includes some late-
> workout sprints, your second interval workout of the week is a slight
> extension of the workout you did last week with just a bit more stress piled
> on in order to keep the challenges, and improvement, rising.
> 
> Following a light Friday spin, your weekend begins with a marginally tougher
> round of hard-start, strength endurance intervals followed by a mildly more
> demanding version of last week's more basic Sweet Spot workout. Skip the long
> SST repeats and go longer and slower if you prefer, in which case Mount Cook
> and Big Mountain are both good choices.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Freel +4

* **NP**: 166
* **IF**: 83%

**Description**:

> Freel +4 consists of 3 sets of 6x70-seconds at 127% FTP with brief, 40-second
> recoveries between intervals, all followed by 45 minutes at 65% FTP.

### Wednesday 

* **Name**: Pettit +1
* **Duration**: 1 hour
* **TSS**: 43.0
* **NP**: 132
* **IF**: 66%

**Description**:

> Pettit is an hour of Aerobic Endurance spent mostly between 60-70% FTP and
> includes Form Sprints, Endurance Spinning intervals, and Pistons/Kick and Pull
> pedaling drills.
> 
> Form Sprints: Practice high-rpm sprint simulations at low power outputs to
> reinforce proper sprinting technique by jumping out-of-the-saddle and winding
> up a light gear. As your cadence reaches its controllable peak, gracefully
> transition into the saddle where you can shift gears if necessary. These
> sprints are only 10s long and are all about leg speed, form, and technique.
> Experiment with which foot to lead with, and learn how to generate a lot of
> leg speed in very little time.
> 
> Endurance Spinning: Practice spinning slightly quicker than your natural,
> self-selected cadence. Ride at a cadence that's at the very top of your
> comfortable rpm range and remain there for a solid 5 minutes. The goal is to
> learn to turn the pedals more quickly with less force (muscle stress) thereby
> improving your ability to remain predominantly aerobic over a wide range of
> rpm's. If your HR rises more than a few BPM, you're pedaling too quickly -
> take it easy and stay relaxed but quick.
> 
> Pistons: Few if any riders need to practice pushing down on the pedals, but
> improvements in how well your knees move are both beneficial to economy and
> joint health. As you pedal, pay close attention to how your knees track. They
> should move directly up, directly down - like pistons - with little if any
> lateral movement, especially at the top of each pedalstroke. Focus on one knee
> for 30s before switching sides.
> 
> Kick and Pull: A balanced pedalstroke is dependent upon consistent tension on
> your bike's drivetrain throughout the entire pedalstroke. Reinforce your
> ability to maintain tension through the weakest portions of the pedalstroke,
> the top and bottom quadrants. As your knee approaches top-dead-center, lightly
> kick your toes into the fronts of your shoes, and as your feet approach
> bottom-dead-center, lightly pull your heels into the backs of your shoes -
> kick and pull. Focus on just the kick for 30s, just the pull for 30s, then
> eventually both for 30s simultaneously.
> 
> Modifications: 2 late-ride sprints

* **IF**: 83%

**Description**:

> Galena +3 is 4x20-minute Sweet Spot intervals at 90% FTP with 6 minutes of
> recovery between each.

## Week 3

> Week 3 ups the VO2max requirements slightly with shorter intervals but a few
> more of them in order to keep challenging your rising aerobic work capacity.
> Use last week's repeats as recon for these shorter efforts, which could mean
> leaving the Workout Intensity alone if you happened to need a reduction last
> time.
> 
> Following your midweek Endurance + Sprints workout, you'll tackle another
> subtle progression over last week's high-valley VO2max repeats. These
> demanding valleys between surges are aimed at keeping your heart rate and
> breathing elevated such that each set of intervals taxes your aerobic engine
> as hard as multi-minute VO2max repeats, just in a more engaging, race-like
> manner.
> 
> Due to the severity of everything you've faced this week so far, your Friday
> ride is the shortest you'll see. And you always have the option of skipping
> this workout during any week where you think a day's rest is beneficial in
> terms of the upcoming weekend's workout productivity.  
> 
> Speaking of which, you'll first square off against yet another escalation in
> the war against muscle fatigue as you battle your most challenging round of
> hard-start intervals yet since they force you all the way up to 95% of your
> FTP right after each opening sprint.
> 
> Then, you'll close out this pre-recovery-week round of workouts with another
> mildly progressed version of your Sweet Spot workout where the intervals grow
> to a whopping 30-minutes each, but you'll find a welcome 1-minute reprieve
> smack dab in the middle of each of them. Exchange this one for Tenaya or Mount
> Cook again if you're interested in going easier but longer.

## Week 5

> It's highly likely your fitness has improved over the course of the first 4
> weeks of your Build conditioning. So you'll want to adjust your training zones
> accordingly and keep the challenges appropriately...challenging. As such, Week
> 5 begins with another Ramp Test, an assessment workout you're welcome to swap
> for the 8 Minute FTP Test of the 20 Minute FTP Test if you prefer.
> 
> After a temporarily longer midweek Endurance workout that makes up for some of
> the TSS lacking in your assessment workout, it's onto some Threshold intervals
> that each begins with some big-gear work. These big-gear starts will fill the
> void created by the omission of the sprints you were seeing each Tuesday.
> Importantly, you can perform these starts in any gear that suits you if joint
> pain, especially in your knees, is a concern.
> 
> After your second weekday Endurance ride, the first workout of each weekend
> for the next few weeks will be a combination workout aimed at addressing your
> short-power capabilities while still heaping ample attention on your more
> sustained-power capacity, and they each contain at least a little mid-workout
> Endurance work.
> 
> Then it's onto some more straightforward Sweet Spot work where you're welcome
> to go the longer/slower route by substituting Grandfather (sprints included)
> or Town Hill in place of Juneau.

## Week 7

> Your final pre-recovery week starts with another bump in workload in the form
> of slightly longer short/short repeats, moves on to your usual midweek
> Endurance, recovery-ish ride, and then furthers the demand of last week's big-
> gear starts by again lifting the requirements of that initial, high-power
> push. The rest of each interval remains the same though, so you're fully
> versed in the challenge of surviving a post-sprint effort.
> 
> Noodle through a short, end-of-week ride and mentally brace yourself for your
> final weekend of workouts before wrapping up this Short Power Build phase.
> 
> The weekend in question begins with a fun if painful combination of ascending-
> duration, slightly suprathreshold repeats bent on furthering both your ability
> to ride explosively as well as sustain power a little above your FTP and some
> downright unforgiving attacking repeats that will leaving you feeling ready
> for **any** of your early-season, lower-priority races.  
> 
> Last but not least, you'll face your biggest round of Sweet Spot intervals
> yet, but more bite-size than last week's. And as usual, you're welcome to go
> the longer, slower route either indoors or out. Should you stay inside, check
> out Mount Cook or Tenaya, even Allegheny would work.

> again time to rest up with a repeat of Week 4's recovery cycle.
> 
> By repeating your recovery weeks in nearly identical fashion, you're provided
> with an opportunity to modify your recovery workloads to fit your particular
> recovery profile. Did your last recovery week leave you feeling a bit too
> tired to dive back into training? Perhaps you didn't need quite as much rest
> as you were given.
> 
> In any case, similar recovery weeks provide a consistent protocol that can be
> altered as necessary such that you feel eager and rested heading into your
> next round of training without feeling like you backed off too far.

### Saturday 

* **Name**: Gibbs +1
* **Duration**: 2 hours
* **TSS**: 90.0
* **NP**: 134
* **IF**: 67%

**Description**:

> Gibbs consists of nearly 2hrs of Aerobic Endurance spent between 60-70% FTP
> and includes Form Sprints, Endurance Spinning intervals, and some Single-Leg
> Focus drills.
> 
> Form Sprints: Practice high-rpm sprint simulations at low power outputs to
> reinforce proper sprinting technique by jumping out-of-the-saddle and winding
> up a light gear. As your cadence reaches its controllable peak, gracefully
> transition into the saddle where you can shift gears if necessary. These
> sprints are only 10s long and are all about leg speed, form, and technique.
> Experiment with which foot to lead with, and learn how to generate a lot of
> leg speed in very little time.
> 
> Endurance Spinning: Practice spinning slightly quicker than your natural,
> self-selected cadence. Ride at a cadence that's at the very top of your
> comfortable rpm range and remain there for a solid 5 minutes. The goal is to
> learn to turn the pedals more quickly with less force (muscle stress) thereby
> improving your ability to remain predominantly aerobic over a wide range of
> rpm's. If your HR rises more than a few BPM, you're pedaling too quickly -
> take it easy and stay relaxed but quick.
> 
> Single-Leg Focus: The objective here is to learn to more effectively apply
> power through the entire pedalstroke by focusing strictly on one leg's
> activity through the bottom, upstroke, and over the top of the pedalstroke.
> For 90 seconds at a time, devote your attention to one leg before switching to
> the other. Your cadence may fall slightly, but these drills typically come
> more naturally to less experienced "one-leggers". Pay particular attention to
> lightly pulling your foot across the bottom, lifting your knee lightly upward
> and then softly kicking over the top of each pedalstroke. Add this drill
> indoors or outdoors as often as you like, more frequently if you recognize a
> substantial difference in one leg's strength or coordination.
> 
> Modifications: 4 late-ride sprints
