# Trainer Road Plan: Half Distance Triathlon - Low Volume

> With the necessary endurance & strength in the bank, the objective becomes
> growing as familiar as possible with the very specific demands of racing long
> but not really long. This challenging mix of speed & endurance demands the
> very particular preparation offered over the course of this final pre-race
> block of training.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Ramp Test** It's pretty likely you've seen some improvement over
> the course of your Build phase, so we'll begin this specialized training phase
> by reassessing your FTP such that the final weeks leading up to your most
> important races are appropriately demanding and as productive as possible. Use
> the same test format you've used before, and make sure you feel rested and
> motivated heading into this workout.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max Intervals (2350m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m BB Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 5x150m Hard, RPE9 w/ 75s rest between intervals; 8x25m
> K &R drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 10min working up to Easy-Moderate,
> RPE 6 pace to warm up, then have a go at 5x2-minute Hard, RPE9 high-speed
> surges with 2 minutes of recovery after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool
> down for a total of 40 minutes of running.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Mansfield** Get a feel for your newly estimated Functional
> Threshold Power with a reasonably tame but still demanding set of repeats far
> enough above your FTP to challenge your ability to generate power in your aero
> bars. If you find that you can keep your power on Target while riding low,
> commit to performing these 105% intervals in your aero position; otherwise,
> save the aero work for subthreshold workouts.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Speed Intervals (2450m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m F drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 3x400m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 75s
> rest between intervals; 5x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 8x25m K drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run + Strides** Return once more to an Easy-Moderate 60
> minutes at RPE6 pace and include another 6x20-second relaxed sprints at RPE10
> with 40 seconds of rest after each one.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Leavitt** Working steadily for 70 minutes - truly steadily
> considering the unrelenting nature of indoor trainers - is often surprisingly
> difficult for many riders. If, however, you wish to further the challenge and
> lift your weekly training load a little or perhaps you're targeting a higher
> power % during the bike leg of your race(s), check out the +1 and +2 versions
> of this same workout.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2800m)** Warm-Up 200m Easy, RPE 4; 2400m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 200m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Repeat your longest run thus far by logging
> 1hr40min at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6 pace.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> RPE4 OR compete in a B-priority practice race.

## Week 5

> _Tuesday_ **Elwell** This assortment of efforts devotes a little time to each
> of the supra-threshold power outputs you've employed over prior weeks in order
> to lift your sustainable power. But at this point in your training, the goal
> shifts from building capabilities toward maintaining them while gradually
> shedding some of the residual fatigue they brought on.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max Intervals (2450m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 6x150m Hard, RPE9 w/ 75s rest between intervals; 8x25m
> K &R; drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Tempo Run** Run 10min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE6 to warm up, then
> run steadily, Moderate-Hard, RPE8 for 20 minutes; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to
> cool down for a total of 40 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Mont Gosford** More mid-week Tempo work spent at the higher end
> of the aerobic realm in order to afford opportunities to spend plenty of time
> riding aero while practicing a pace similar to that which you'll sustain on
> race day. For a slightly greater challenge, have a crack at Most Gosford +1
> and spend a little time pushing your power close to your FTP.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Speed Intervals (2550m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m SC drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x250m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 60s

> _Friday_ **Base Run + Strides** Return once more to an Easy-Moderate 70
> minutes at RPE6 pace and include 6x20-second relaxed sprints at RPE10 with 40
> seconds of rest after each one.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Ragged** Last week introduced you to this exhaustive workout
> format while this week grows the demand noticeably. The power requirements
> stay the same, but each step asks that you endure your efforts for
> substantially longer thereby increasing your ability to sustain higher speeds
> for longer and longer durations. Stay aero as much as possible, but sit up
> when you're considering a backpedal break. Often enough, just riding tall for
> a minute or two is all that's really necessary to keep the pedals turning
> over.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (3000m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE 4; 2400m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE 4
>
