# Trainer Road Plan: Sprint Triathlon Build - Low Volume

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1400m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 6x25m CU
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 4x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 200m
> easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_   **Ramp Test**  With 4 weeks of base work in your legs, it's time
> to reassess your FTP in order to keep your workouts in line with your
> increasing fitness. Stick with the same workout format (Ramp Test, 8 Minute
> FTP Test or 20 Minute FTP Test) that you used the first time and count this as
> the first strength-endurance workout of your Tri Build training block.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run** Run 30min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold Intervals (1400m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 6x25m F
> &T Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 4x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 45s rest
> between intervals; 4x25m SK Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 200m
> easy, RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Ruskin** Working this close to FTP takes focus and the ability to
> cope with the inevitable discomfort that comes with sustaining a workload this
> high. Efforts like these prepare your mind for the even higher demands that
> accompany riding a little above your FTP during a race-paced, bike leg, and
> they do this while also lifting your ability to hold high watts for longer
> durations.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** Run 30min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Base Intervals


**Description**:

> 250m Easy Warm-Up (RPE4) 6x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest 7x100m Easy-Moderate
> (RPE6) w/ 5s rest 4x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest 200m Easy Cool-Down (RPE4)


### Wednesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1500m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 6x25m FS

> easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Baird -1** VO2max efforts are always useful when it comes to
> adjusting to the severity of suprathreshold efforts, but they're especially
> useful in the context of a 20k bike leg done above FTP. By building your
> capacity for work done well above FTP, working only slightly above FTP will
> become that much more achievable and greatly increase your odds of running
> exceptionally well off the bike.
>

> Then, you'll dismount and transition quickly into your running gear right
> before you take off on a short10-minute transition run at an Easy-Moderate,
> RPE6 pace in order to get a feel for some heavier leg fatigue coming off a
> more aggressive bike effort.

## Week 3

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1600m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 6x25m SA
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 9x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest

> easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Shortoff -1** Having faced some 1-minute efforts at this same
> wattage, you're now armed with experience that can help you adjust the
> intensity of these longer intervals in such a way that you last the entire 2
> minutes each time. If a reduction to 110 or 115% makes the difference between
> completing each interval versus ducking out early, it's far better to drop
> your watts a little and keep your pedals turning. Make each of these intervals
> as demanding - and productive - as possible by holding your highest repeatable
> 2-minute power 6 times over.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run** Run 40min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6

> _Saturday_ **Donner** Having earlier endured similar but slightly shorter
> efforts like these, it's time to lift the demands enough to challenge your
> rising capabilities even more. Consider using each of these 12-minute
> intervals as a restrained but powerful simulation of the early miles of your
> 20k bike leg.

> 
> _Wednesday_ **Mills** Upping last week's VO2max volume by a full set of 3
> intervals may sound a bit hefty, but these 'peak and fade' repeats are a
> little more forgiving in nature and there's even a little bit of rest between
> each set. So while this may not seem like a recovery week format, the recovery
> time following shorties like these is often surprisingly quick.

> week. Then, you'll dismount and transition quickly into your running gear and
> head out on another short10-minute transition run at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6
> pace, once more practicing your ability to handle the change in muscle stress
> of going from pedaling to striding.
