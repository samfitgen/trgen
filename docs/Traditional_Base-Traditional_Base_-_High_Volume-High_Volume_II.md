# Trainer Road Plan: Traditional Base - High Volume II

> The high-volume version of the Traditional Base II training phase will have
> you on the bike 5 times each week for somewhere between 1 hour to 3.5 hours
> with Recovery Week rides numbering only 4 and lasting 2 hours.
> 
> We have 3 main goals during this phase of training which are to continue the
> development of your aerobic endurance by further improving your fat-for-fuel
> preference via a fair amount of time still at low intensities. We'll also
> target improvements in your ability to generate higher amounts of force on the
> bike in a manner less likely to cause joint tissue damage or foster poor
> movement patterns when under heavy pedaling loads. Finally, with the addition
> of some Tempo riding we'll lay the basis for Base III's development of your
> muscular endurance. There remains an emphasis on pedal speed & economy which
> will be addressed via many of the same drills from Base I, each tied to
> particular workouts.
> 
> Riders focused on improving their time trial performance, e.g. stage racers,
> multisport athletes, etc. should consider extending this training phase by 1
> week for a total of 5 weeks. Ultra-endurance riders should again consider
> extending this phase by an extra 2 weeks for a total of 6 weeks.

## Week 1

> The first week of Base II will start with an opportunity to assess changes in
> your sustainable power via the Ramp Test, or if you prefer, the 8 Minute FTP
> Test or the 20 Minute FTP Test. Alternatively, you can perform Week 2's
> Tuesday workout in place of the FTP Assessment if you've already accounted for
> possible improvements in fitness or simply aren't concerned. Following a
> midweek Aerobic Endurance ride, you'll face your first Tempo efforts as well
> as your first Hill Ride and with them your first exposure to a slightly higher
> level of intensity. The week closes with a long Aerobic Endurance ride which
> incorporates a number of speed and efficiency drills.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> The second week of Base II slightly ups the duration of your midweek AE ride,
> Hill Ride and long AE/Drills workout. While you're working through the same
> drills you faced in Base I, there ought to be a noticeable difference in their
> fluidity and quality, maintain this trend by continuing to practice these
> drills as they're likely to fall by the wayside during your upcoming advanced
> conditioning - make the most of them while the intensity is still relatively
> low.

### Thursday 

* **Name**: Grandfather
* **Duration**: 2 hours and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 134.0
* **NP**: 146
* **IF**: 73%

**Description**:

> 2.5 hours of Tempo intervals spent between 70-80% FTP with brief,
> intermittent, 1 to 3-minute recoveries at 55% FTP. This workout also includes
> 3x10s Strength Sprints, 5-minutes between each as well as some Endurance
> Spinning intervals and some Single-Leg Focus drills.
> 
> Strength Sprints: Practice turning a big gear as forcefully as possible in
> order to recruit as many muscle fibers as you can. From a near stop and in the
> biggest gear you can gracefully turn over without exceeding 90rpm in 12
> pedalstrokes, stand and hold onto your handlebar drops while driving each foot
> down as hard as you can. Maintain excellent form and if you reach 90rpm inside
> of 12 pedalstrokes, choose a larger gear next time. **Note: When using a load-
> restricted trainer like a CompuTrainer or KICKR, consider switching to Slope
> Mode for your Strength Sprints.
> 
> Endurance Spinning: Practice spinning slightly quicker than your natural,
> self-selected cadence. Ride at a cadence that's at the very top of your
> comfortable rpm range and remain there for a solid 5 minutes. The goal is to
> learn to turn the pedals more quickly with less force (muscle stress) thereby
> improving your ability to remain predominantly aerobic over a wide range of
> rpm's. If your HR rises more than a few BPM, you're pedaling too quickly -
> take it easy and stay relaxed but quick.
> 
> Single-Leg Focus: The objective here is to learn to more effectively apply
> power through the entire pedalstroke by focusing strictly on one leg's
> activity through the bottom, upstroke, and over the top of the pedalstroke.
> For 90 seconds at a time, devote your attention to one leg before switching to
> the other. Your cadence may fall slightly, but these drills typically come
> more naturally to less experienced "one-leggers". Pay particular attention to
> lightly pulling your foot across the bottom, lifting your knee lightly upward
> and then softly kicking over the top of each pedalstroke. Add this drill
> indoors or outdoors as often as you like, more frequently if you recognize a
> substantial difference in one leg's strength or coordination.

## Week 4

> Week 4 of Base II will cut the workload down to its lowest point and give you

> Recovery instead) in order to allow your body to absorb the stress of the
> preceding 3 weeks, and while you'll still be riding 4 times this week and
> you'll still be integrating some force work and efficiency drills, you should
> emerge from this week ready to take on greater challenges in the weeks ahead.
