# Trainer Road Plan: Sprint Distance Triathlon - Low Volume

> As athletes draw closer to their events, more specific conditioning becomes
> the focus of each subsequent training block. The increased focus on Threshold
> and VO2max work here make it abundantly clear that Sprint triathlons require
> speed in even measure with endurance.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1700m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 6x25m CU
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 10x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 4x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 200m
> easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Ramp Test** One final FTP assessment awaits since it's very
> likely you've seen improvement in your highest steady-state power over the
> course of your previous Build conditioning. Stick with your practiced and
> reliable assessment format - Ramp Test, 8 Minute or 20 Minute - and consider
> today your first strength-endurance workout of this new training block.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 10min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 to
> warm up, then repeat 16 Hard, RPE 9, 30-second near-sprints, recovering for
> only 30 seconds after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down for a total of
> about 35 minutes of running
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim V02max Intervals (1150m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 6x25m F &T
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x75m Hard, RPE9 w/ 30s rest between
> intervals; 4x25m SK Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 200m easy,
> RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Frissell** This weekend brings one more opportunity to practice
> repeating efforts slightly below your FTP in order to further your base of
> high-end endurance prior to the more specific endurance work you'll see over
> the next several weeks. Spend as much time as possible in your aero position
> as long as your power doesn't stray off the mark.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** Run 40min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6

> (RPE6) w/ 5s rest 4x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest 200m Cool-Down Easy (RPE4)


### Wednesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> 
> _Wednesday_ **Shortoff +1** The greatest benefit of VO2max works comes with

> those pedals turning.

> to avoid it. If possible, spend some time in your aero posture, but on-Target

> painful interval duration, but a little less rest in order to test your power
> as well as your endurance as we aim to increase your ability to ride above
> your current capabilities. Again, ride aero if possible, but the greater
> concern here is your ability to sustain steady watts substantially above your
> FTP.
