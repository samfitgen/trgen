# Trainer Road Plan: Full Distance Triathlon Build - Mid Volume

> In what amounts to as much a battle of will as one of physical capability,
> ultra-distance triathletes have to demonstrate exceedingly high levels of
> fitness & mental fortitude. These Build blocks will address both via longer,
> slightly less intense, but no less challenging workloads.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base + Threshold Intervals (2800m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 10x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 8x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 4x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 45s rest between
> intervals; 10x25m K drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
> RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_   **Ramp Test**  With 12 weeks of base work in your legs, it's time
> to reassess your FTP in order to keep your workouts in line with your
> increasing fitness. Stick with the same workout format (Ramp Test, 8 Minute
> FTP Test or 20 Minute FTP Test) that you used the first time and count this as
> the first strength-endurance workout of your Tri Build training block.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 15min working up to Easy-Moderate,
> RPE 6 pace to warm up, then insert 12x1-minute Hard, RPE9 high-speed surges
> with a single minute of recovery after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool
> down for a total of 50 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Brick Workout** Gibraltar + 30min Base Run: In the midst of a
> 105-minute bike workout, you'll sustain 90 minutes of effort between 80-85%
> FTP pushing you very close to the effort you'll try to hold during your race-
> day bike leg. Then, you'll dismount and transition quickly into your running
> gear right before you take off on a 30-minute run at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6
> pace in order to get a chance to settle into something close to your race
> pace.
> 
> _Friday_ **Pettit** Take it easy on the bike today while staying active but
> keeping recovery at the forefront of your mind.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Base + VO2max + Speed Intervals (2750m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy,
> RPE4; 10x25m F &T Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate,
> RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals; 10x75m Hard, RPE9 w/ 45s rest between

> SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Makalu** Backing things down a bit from where the Base plan left
> off, your long aerobic endurance ride continues its multi-prong attack on
> taxing your aerobic system in a manner more in line with the actual demands
> faced during your 100+ mile time trial, on familiarizing you with the stresses
> of multiple consecutive hours on the bike (and in your aero position, no
> less), helping you practice your imperative on-the-bike-nutrition and
> hydration, and allowing you to build that vital sense of belief in your
> ability to keep powering your bike for an impressively extended period of
> time.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Recovery Run** Later in the day, run 35 minutes at an Easy, RPE
> 4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (3300m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE 4; 2600m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE 4

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!
