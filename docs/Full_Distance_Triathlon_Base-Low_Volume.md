# Trainer Road Plan: Full Distance Triathlon Base - Low Volume

> The low-volume version of the Full Distance Triathlon Base plan has
> triathletes swimming three times each week for up to 7700m, on the bike 3-4
> times each week for slightly more than 6 hours total during the peak riding
> week (including a brick workout every other week) and running no more than 4
> hours in the highest run-volume week.
> 
> The main objective here get time-constrained Full Distance triathletes to and
> through a full-distance triathlon via the necessary base fitness in all 3
> disciplines, all in the minimum amount of time - no more than 13 hours per
> week, often substantially less.
> 
> Note: Double-day workouts can be done in any order and separated by as little
> or as much time as you choose as long as you can keep the quality of both
> workouts high.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_   **FTP Assessment**  Get a solid estimate of your current fitness
> via the Ramp Test. You have the option of using the 8-minute FTP Test or the
> 20 Minute FTP Test if you prefer, just see to it that you reassess using the
> same workout each time.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1600m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 8x25m CU
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 8x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m
> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 40min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> then conclude your run with 2x20s controlled sprints, RPE10, preferably up a
> moderate hill that allows a gait similar to your flat-terrain gait.   Recover
> for only 40 seconds between these efforts.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Ericsson** Time to target leg speed with the aim of improving
> your pedal efficiency (or your ability to turn the pedals with the minimal
> amount of effort and energy). You’ll work in a narrow but highly productive
> power range that’s close enough to your FTP to get your mind and body ready
> for the more rigorous workouts to follow in later training phases but not a
> range that’s too taxing to prevent fairly rapid recovery.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (1600m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 8x25m F
> drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m of 25m Easy, RPE4/25m Hard, RPE8,
> 10s rest between intervals; 8x25m SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-
> Down 300m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run** Run 30min Easy-Moderate, RPE6.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Berkshire** Steady mileage at a highly aerobic work rate is the
> name of the game. Use these unrelenting, long stretches of time to pack some
> fatigue into your slow-twitch fibers and grow their capabilities as a result.
> By lifting your aerobic capacity, you’ll become capable of working at higher
> percentages of your FTP while relying on less glycogen in the process - last
> longer, go faster, burn less sugar.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (1700m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 1200m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 55min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Walk briefly (no more
> than a minute each time) if necessary and try to recognize that quick walking
> breaks of a single minute can often keep the form high while costing very
> little in terms of aerobic fitness improvements.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> _Tuesday_ **Shasta** Abiding by the similar strength-routine framework for the
> next few weeks, you’ll try to improve on each prior week’s workout quality by
> dialing in your highest, repeatable 20-second power such that you bury

> 
> _Saturday_ **Brick Workout (Pioneer + 15min Transition Run)** Very much in
> line with the steady-state nature of a full distance triathlon’s bike leg,
> you’ll work steadily for 45 minutes on the bike, in your aero position as
> often as possible, before dismounting, transitioning quickly into your running
> gear and hoofing it at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 for only 15 minutes of
> heavy-leg running experience. Try not to let that initial lack of coordination

> minutes before walking during next week’s base runs.

## Week 3

> _Tuesday_ **Berryessa** If you managed to stay pretty consistent over last
> week’s 7 high-power repeats, add another this week and keep the power high and

> to keep the pedals turning for each interval in its entirety and save the
> recovery/backpedaling for the recovery valleys. Also try to incorporate longer
> stretches of riding in your aero position while the watts are far enough below
> FTP to allow for some relatively comfortable practice holding your power while
> riding low.
>

## Week 11

> _Tuesday_ **Midway** No more total duration than last week - still 18 minutes
> well above FTP - this VO2max workout gives you a chance to tax your anaerobic

> one).
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run for 2 hours at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 and
> endure what promises to be the longest run of your 3-month base plan. Adjust
> the intensity as necessary to last the entire 2 hours, and be sensible in
> terms of occasional walk-break/aid station simulations that can go a long way
> toward helping you retain your running form as the fatigue mounts.
