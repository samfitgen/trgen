# Trainer Road Plan: Half Distance Triathlon - Mid Volume

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max Intervals (2550m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m BB Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 5x150m Hard, RPE9 w/ 75s rest between intervals; 8x25m
> K &R drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Ramp Test** It's pretty likely you've seen some improvement over
> the course of your Build phase, so we'll begin this specialized training phase
> by reassessing your FTP such that the final weeks leading up to your most
> important races are appropriately demanding and as productive as possible. Use
> the same test format you've used before, and make sure you feel rested and
> motivated heading into this workout.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 15min working up to Easy-Moderate,
> RPE 6 pace to warm up, then insert 4x3-minute Hard, RPE9 high-speed surges
> with 3 minutes of recovery after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down for
> a total of 45 minutes of running.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Phoenix + Endurance Run (Brick)** This week's brick consists of a
> 90-minute bike workout where you'll again sustain 75 minutes of effort between
> 80-85% FTP before transitioning into a race-paced60 minutes of running at an
> Easy-Moderate, RPE6 pace where you'll get used to running a little bit longer
> coming off the bike.
> 
> _Friday_ **Whorl** Each of the 8 weeks ahead is likely to end in this workout
> or one very similar to it. Use this ride to accumulate a little extra aerobic
> endurance work, to practice and refine your aero positioning, and to keep your
> muscles pliable and reasonably refreshed. And always feel free to trim the
> duration of this workout if you recognize that you're carrying too much
> fatigue into a demanding weekend of training.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Speed Intervals (2600m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m F drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 3x400m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 75s
> rest between intervals; 6x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 8x25m K drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Piute** During your introduction to this exhaustive workout
> format, each step asks that you endure your efforts for fairly long interval
> durations thereby increasing your ability to sustain higher speeds for longer
> and longer spans of time. Stay aero as much as possible, but sit up when
> you're considering a backpedal break. Often enough, just riding tall for a
> minute or two is all that's really necessary to keep the pedals turning over.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Base Run + Strides** Still coming back from Thursday's brick,
> just run 40 minutes at RPE6 pace and include 6x20-second relaxed sprints at
> RPE10 with 40 seconds of rest after each one.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2700m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE 4; 2000m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Nudge up your longest run again, this time to
> 1hr50min at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6 pace.

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> power in your aero bars. If you find that you can keep your power on Target

> while making small refinements to your aero position, all while keeping your
> muscles supple and ready for the weekend ahead. Ride as short as 30 minutes if
> you're really cooked, but don't do any more than the allotted 75 minutes
> unless you're certain it won't degrade the quality of your weekend's brick.

> K &R drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Jacks +1** Same rules as last week regarding riding in your aero
> position: only do so if you can keep your power on Target. Because the primary
> goal is raising your high-end endurance even more over these final weeks of
> training, and this is best accomplished by pushing your current boundaries
> with fairly short, uncomfortable but sustainable intervals - and ones that are
> a little longer than last week's.
>

> RPE 6 pace to warm up, then this week you'll peak at 6x3-minute Hard, RPE9

> 
> _Saturday_ **Ragged** Time for a tougher version of Week 1's progression
> workout which amounts to a little more work due to slightly longer interval
> steps. Your power will again top out well above your expected race power
> output, but by growing familiar with these higher power demands, every
> workload below them becomes that much more tolerable and less taxing on your
> body as a whole.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Base Run + Strides** Just run an Easy-Moderate 40 minutes at RPE6
> pace and work in 6x20-second relaxed sprints at RPE10 with 40 seconds of rest
