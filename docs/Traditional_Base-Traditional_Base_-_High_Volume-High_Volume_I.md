# Trainer Road Plan: Traditional Base - High Volume I

> The high-volume version of the Traditional Base I training phase will have you
> on the bike 4 times each week for somewhere between 2 hours & 15 minutes to 2
> hours & 45 minutes with Recovery Week rides only lasting 2 hours.
> 
> The primary goal of this phase of training is to develop or improve your
> aerobic endurance by shifting your body's fuel preference toward fat while
> working at low intensities; therefore, this training phase consists entirely
> of Aerobic Endurance (AE) workouts. There is also a heavy emphasis on pedal
> speed & economy which will be addressed via several different types of drills
> tied to each workout.
> 
> New cyclists as well as those who are focused on weight loss may wish to
> repeat this phase back-to-back thereby extending it to twice its length for a
> total of 8 weeks. Intermediate riders along with ultra-endurance riders and
> riders recovering from injury should consider extending this phase by an extra
> 2 weeks for a total of 6 weeks.

## Week 1

> The first week of Base I will offer a chance to assess your incoming fitness
> before it helps you acclimate to extended periods of time in the saddle as
> well as expose you to many of the efficiency drills you'll face over the
> course of this training phase. While the Ramp Test is recommended, feel
> welcome to use the 8 Minute FTP Test or the 20 Minute FTP Test if you prefer.
> 
> Remember, base training is only difficult in terms of duration because the
> intensity is low and very manageable. Some of the efficiency drills will
> increase your sense of exertion and heart rate, but each of these workouts
> should avoid muscle burn and elevations in HR of more than 3bpm over the
> course of the workout.
> 
> Learn to go slow now so that later you can go faster than ever before.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 3

> Week 3 of Base I builds your rides to the phase's highest durations so far

> energy.

## Week 4

> you'll still be riding 4 times this week and you'll still be integrating some
> efficiency drills, you should emerge from this week ready to take on greater
> challenges in the weeks ahead.
