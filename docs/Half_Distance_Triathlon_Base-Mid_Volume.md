# Trainer Road Plan: Half Distance Triathlon Base - Mid Volume

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1700m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 8x25m CU
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 8x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m
> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Tuesday_   **FTP Assessment**  Get a solid estimate of your current fitness
> via the Ramp Test. You have the option of using the 8-minute FTP Test or the
> 20 Minute FTP Test if you prefer, just see to it that you reassess using the
> same workout each time.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Run 40min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> randomly insert 6x30s bursts of high speed, RPE9 over the course of the run
> with at least 1 minute of recovery running between bursts.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Brick Workout (Pioneer + 15min Transition Run)** Very much in
> line with the steady-state nature of a half distance triathlon’s bike leg,
> you’ll work steadily for 45 minutes on the bike, in your aero position as
> often as possible, before dismounting, transitioning quickly into your running
> gear and hoofing it at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 for only 15 minutes of
> heavy-leg running experience. Try not to let that initial lack of coordination
> discourage you - it will pass before you know it.
> 
> _Friday_ **Ericsson** Time to target leg speed with the aim of improving your
> pedal efficiency (or your ability to turn the pedals with the minimal amount
> of effort and energy). You’ll work in a narrow but highly productive power
> range that’s close enough to your FTP to get your mind and body ready for the
> more rigorous workouts to follow in later training phases but not a range
> that’s too taxing to prevent fairly rapid recovery.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (1700m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 8x25m F
> drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m of 25m Easy, RPE4/25m Hard, RPE8,
> 10s rest between intervals; 8x25m SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-
> Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Antelope** 50 total minutes of endurance work comprise your
> weekend ride as you face fairly long intervals, spending as much time down
> low, in your aero position as you can tolerate. Fortunately, the recovery
> between each interval is pretty generous in the interest of keeping the
> steady, endurance-building watts comin’ for each of the 5 intervals. This is
> where your ability to ride at roughly this work level for multiple hours
> begins.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 30min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> then conclude your run with 2x20s controlled sprints, RPE10, preferably uphill
> w/ 40s of recovery between them. Keep the hill fairly tame such that you can
> run with a bit of speed and a fairly open stride, not too choppy.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (1800m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 1200m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 50min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Walk briefly when
> necessary and try to recognize that quick walking breaks of a single minute
> can often keep the form high while costing very little in terms of aerobic
> fitness improvements.

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Shasta** Time to build some capacity! In particular, strength. By
> drilling it for a short 20 seconds at a time, your muscles will receive a
> loud-and-clear request for for more - more muscle, more work, more power. This
> is true, on-the-bike strength work that will not only lift your ability to
> power the pedals for short durations but also much, much longer ones.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Run 40min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> randomly insert a couple more 30s bursts of high speed, RPE9 for a total of 8
> this week. Separate them by at least 1 minute of regular-pace running between
> bursts.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Tunnabora** While keeping your watts in a narrow and reasonably

> then conclude run with 2x20s controlled sprints, RPE10, preferably uphill w/
> 40s of recovery between them. Keep the hill’s grade reasonable such that you
> can run pretty naturally, pretty fast, but work substantially harder.
> 
> _Friday_ **Mount Field** Growing the interval duration just a couple minutes,
> this is your first of many opportunities to gradually work up your ability to
> keep turning the pedals at watts close enough to your FTP to be challenging
> and productive but also forgiving in terms of recovery and tolerable in the
> process. Make sure to spend some on-Target time in your aero position, at
> least half of each interval.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (1700m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 8x25m CU

> Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Brick Workout (Cumberland + 30min Base Run)** This week, you’ll
> first grow your bike time duration a bit, riding in your aero position as
> often as possible, before dismounting, transitioning quickly into your running
> gear and enduring a short base run at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 for 30 solid
> minutes. Do your best to make them continuous minutes, but if your strategy
> includes running breaks or this early point in the training season merits
> them, walk for a minute when necessary.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (1900m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 1200m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 55min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Again, walk briefly
> when necessary but try to grow your continuous running stretches a minute or
> two each week. So if you ran for 8 minutes last week before walking for a
> minute, try to run for 9 or 10 minutes before walking during next week’s base
> runs.

> 
> _Tuesday_ **Berryessa** If you managed to stay pretty consistent over last
> week’s 7 high-power repeats, add another this week and keep the power high and
> steady throughout all 8 efforts. But if your power started falling off during
> the later repeats, dial your effort down a little bit during the earlier
> 30-second charges and try to finish as strongly as you start.

> but just as fast.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Brick Workout (Pioneer + 20min Race-Pace Run)** This week will
> drop the bike duration back down a bit but increase the run intensity. You’ll
> ride pretty steadily for 45 minutes, in your aero position as often as
> possible, then dismount and transition quickly into your running gear for 20
> minutes at a harder-than-race-pace effort. Get a sense of what it’s like to
> overdo the opening couple miles of your half marathon, and build some strength
> in the process.
> 
> _Friday_ **Tallac** It’s time for some more steady-effort repeats in the Sweet
> Spot and preferably in your aero position, at least for a few minutes at a
> time. Learn to spend productive, on-Target durations in your low position
> while the effort is manageably low and less likely to crush you under the
> combined weight of aerodynamics and sustained riding power.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (2000m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 8x25m FS
> drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x150m of 50m Build from RPE4 to RPE8/25m

> rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Boarstone** Steady mileage at a highly aerobic work rate is the
> name of the game. Use these unrelenting, long stretches of time to pack some
> fatigue into your slow-twitch fibers and grow their capabilities as a result.
> By lifting your aerobic capacity, you’ll become capable of working at higher
> percentages of your FTP while relying on less glycogen in the process - last
> longer, go faster, burn less sugar.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 30min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> then conclude your run with 4x20s controlled sprints, RPE10, this week,
> ideally on that same hill w/ 40s of recovery between them. If you’ve yet to
> find the same hill, keep looking for something that makes running fast hard
> but...fast.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2000m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 1500m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 60min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Shoot for those
> slightly longer stretches of continuous running this week but keep your form
> at the top of your list of priorities. Much like swimming, small improvements
> in your technique can go a long way toward making you faster (and less prone
> to injury).

> sprinkle in just 8x30s bursts of high speed, RPE9 this week. Separate them by
> at least 1 minute of regular-pace running between bursts.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Goddard** With equal emphasis split between forming high-end base
> for later improvements in FTP and form work aimed at improving your pedaling
> efficiency, this workout will expose any weaknesses in form while introducing
> short-duration strength-endurance intervals that target your ability to
> sustain speed and power to the pedals.

> sprints; 8x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Baird -1** Time to work on developing some high-end power as you
> target both leg speed and leg strength for one intense minute at a time. Think
> of VO2max work as pulling your power up from the top while the later Sweet
> Spot workouts push your endurance up from the bottom.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run + Anaerobic Repeats** 15min Warm-Up, Easy, RPE4 then
> perform 6x1-minutes all-out repeats, RPE10 with 3 minutes of recovery, RPE2
> between them; 10min Cool-Down, RPE4 for roughly 45 minutes of running.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Brick Workout (Cumberland + 30min Base Run)** Time for a repeat
> performance of an earlier brick, this time with a bit more fitness. So feel
> welcome to push the bike leg a little harder this time, then keep your short
> base run at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 for 30 minutes of smoother, more
> controlled running.
> 
> _Friday_ **Glassy** These 4 intervals will undulate between modest and mildly
> challenging levels of effort while splitting a focus between aerobic
> improvements as well as muscular ones. So ideally, you’ll improve your ability
> to burn fat for fuel and pull more oxygen from your bloodstream while you also
> derive some improvements in your higher-end, more muscle-based endurance.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (2100m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 8x25m HCU
> drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x200m of 50m Build from RPE4 to RPE8/50m
> Descend from RPE8 to RPE4, 15s rest between intervals; 8x25m K &R; drills
> w/15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Laurentian** Steady mileage at a highly aerobic work rate is once
> again the objective and steady hours of unrelenting, seemingly unending muscle
> stress, light though it may be, will slow-cook your endurance fibers and grow
> their capabilities over time. Keep it fairly easy, keep it long, and limit any
> backpedal-breaks you might need to 10 seconds each.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 35min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> then conclude your run with 6x20s controlled sprints, RPE10, preferably up a
> mild hill w/ 40s of recovery between sprints.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2100m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 1500m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run for 65min at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. The
> goal here is steady, continuous mileage and a slower form of fatigue than
> you’ll see during your shorter base runs. Accordingly, reduce the intensity to
> 4 or 5RPE if it keeps your legs turning over, non-stop and injury-free.
