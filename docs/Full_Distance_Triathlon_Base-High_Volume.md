# Trainer Road Plan: Full Distance Triathlon Base - High Volume

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2100m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4; 12x25m CU
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 12x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 400m
> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Tuesday_   **FTP Assessment**  Get a solid estimate of your current fitness
> via the Ramp Test. You have the option of using the 8-minute FTP Test or the
> 20 Minute FTP Test if you prefer, just see to it that you reassess using the
> same workout each time.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2100m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4; 12x25m FS
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 10x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 400m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 45min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> then conclude your run with 2x20s controlled sprints, RPE10, preferably uphill
> w/ 40s of recovery between them.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Brick Workout (Cumberland + 20min Transition Run)** Very much in
> line with the steady-state nature of a full distance triathlon’s bike leg,
> you’ll work very steadily for 60 minutes on the bike, in your aero position as
> often as possible, before dismounting, transitioning quickly into your running
> gear and hoofing it at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 for 20 minutes of heavy-leg
> running experience. Try not to let that initial lack of coordination
> discourage you - it will pass before you know it.
> 
> _Friday_ **Ericsson** Time to target leg speed with the aim of improving your
> pedal efficiency (or your ability to turn the pedals with the minimal amount
> of effort and energy). You’ll work in a narrow but highly productive power
> range that’s close enough to your FTP to get your mind and body ready for the
> more rigorous workouts to follow in later training phases but not a range
> that’s too taxing to prevent fairly rapid recovery.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (2150m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4; 12x25m F
> drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x150m of 50m Easy, RPE4/25m Hard, RPE8,
> 15s rest between intervals; 12x25m SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-
> Down 400m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Big Mountain** Steady mileage at a highly aerobic work rate is
> the name of the game. Use these unrelenting, long stretches of time to pack
> some fatigue into your slow-twitch fibers and grow their capabilities as a
> result. By lifting your aerobic capacity, you’ll become capable of working at
> higher percentages of your FTP while relying on less glycogen in the process -
> last longer, go faster, burn less sugar.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Recovery Run** Run 30min Easy, RPE4. Keep it easy and don’t
> hesitate to use minute-long walking breaks if it preserves the quality of your
> running, even over this short duration.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2100m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 1500m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run for 90min at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. The
> goal here is steady, continuous mileage and a slower form of fatigue than
> you’ll see during your shorter base runs. Accordingly, reduce the intensity to
> 4 or 5RPE if it keeps your legs turning over, non-stop and injury-free.

### Monday 

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run** Run 75min Easy-Moderate, RPE6.
> 
> _Friday_ **Fuji** Time to build some capacity! In particular, strength. By
> drilling it for a short 20 seconds at a time, your muscles will receive a

> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.

> rest between intervals; 5x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 12x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 400m easy,
> RPE4.
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Glassy** These 4 intervals will undulate between modest and mildly
> challenging levels of effort while splitting a focus between aerobic
> improvements as well as muscular ones. So ideally, you’ll improve your ability
> to burn fat for fuel and pull more oxygen from your bloodstream while you also
> derive some improvements in your higher-end, more muscle-based endurance.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2300m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4; 12x25m CS
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 12x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 400m easy, RPE4.

> _Wednesday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Run 45min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> randomly insert 6x30s bursts of high speed, RPE9 over the course of the run
> with at least 1 minute of recovery between bursts.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Brick Workout (Phoenix + 20min Transition Run)** Dialing things
> back just a bit to get you back in the swing of things, you’ll ride steadily
> for 75 minutes, rising when necessary but staying aero as much as possible,
> then dismount, transition expertly into your running gear and hoof it at an
> Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 for 20 minutes while you get clear of the riding
> fatigue and establish a manageable pace as promptly as possible. Keep in mind
> that it’s basically never sensible to jack your heart rate above the HR you
> sustain at marathon pace. In other words, don’t go out too hard on the run.
> 
> _Friday_ **Mills** Time to work on developing some high-end power as you
> target both leg speed and leg strength for two intense minutes at a time.
> Think of VO2max work as pulling your power up from the top while the later
> Sweet Spot workouts push your endurance up from the bottom.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Base + Speed + Sprint Intervals (2650m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy,
> RPE4; 12x25m HCU drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 3x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6

> K &R; drills w/15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 400m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Makalu** Continuing your aerobic endurance pursuit via the more
> traditional, long-slow route, you’ll jump up 30 minutes this time. Keep in
> mind that uninterrupted, indoor riding can be 1.2-1.8x as effective as riding
> done outdoors making this 3.75-hour workout potentially closer to 5 or 6 hours
> in training effect all depending on how infrequently you let off the gas
> pedal.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Recovery Run** Run 35min Easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2600m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 2000m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run for 1hr50min at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6,
> the goal again is steady, continuous mileage and that slower form of fatigue.
> Reduce the intensity to 4 or 5RPE if it helps you keep running with minimal
> walk-breaks.

> _Saturday_ **Putuo** One more bump in duration as you work toward your final,

> _Saturday_ **Recovery Run** Run 40min Easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (3200m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 2600m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Much like yesterday’s longest-to-date base ride,
> this 2hr10min run at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6, will be the penultimate step
> in duration before hitting that final, longest endurance run. The goal, as
> always, is steady, continuous mileage and that slow fatigue that will
> eventually grow your aerobic endurance and mental coping boundaries.
