# Trainer Road Plan: General Build - Low Volume

> As the competitive season opens, a necessary shift from basic capabilities
> toward more specific ones takes place. This shift toward specificity is a
> little less pronounced in the type of training aimed at riders seeking to keep
> their events, and necessary capabilities, a bit broader.
> 
> So the overriding goal of the General Build plans is to place fairly even
> emphasis on Threshold training and its focus on extending your durations
> during efforts near your FTP, VO2max work and the ability to repeat hard
> efforts and often in quick succession, and anaerobic intervals aimed at
> increasing your repeatable, near-maximal power outputs.
> 
> We address the shorter, more intense efforts that can make or break a rider as
> the pace kicks up and more severe efforts come one after another while never
> neglecting the Threshold workouts that condition riders to periodically
> sustain near-FTP power output for reasonably long periods even following those
> briefer, high-intensity workloads.  
> 
> This even combination of key workouts suits riders with more general
> aspirations and target events. All-around riders like stage racers - road or
> dirt - and competitors looking for multi-faceted fitness in everything from
> sprints to climbs to time trials need to administer frequent combinations of
> near-FTP output, high-end & repeatable aerobic power, and near-maximal bursts
> of speed. Evenly addressing all of these requirements is what the General
> Build plans are all about.

## Week 1

> First things first: time to assess improvement born out of your recent Base
> training plans allowing you to adjust your FTP, and with it, all of the power
> levels anchored to it. While the Ramp Test is scheduled, you're welcome to use
> the 20 Minute FTP Test or the 8 Minute FTP Test and utilize whichever format
> you prefer.
> 
> Then, considering the suprathreshold nature of your assessment workout, the
> emphasis shifts to strength endurance as you face a muscle-depleting round of
> over-unders that challenge your ability to hold your power very close to your
> newly-elevated FTP for some fairly lengthy durations.
> 
> Once you've bounced back from your weekday workouts, your weekend wraps up
> your first week of training with what could be your first exposure to a
> traditional microbursts that use numerous, closely-set, punchy efforts to
> address your neuromuscular and anaerobic power capabilities as well as your
> aerobic system's ability to support your attempts at repeating them over and
> over.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

* **NP**: 170
* **IF**: 85%

**Description**:

> Carpathian Peak is 3x12-minute over-under intervals with 1-minute valleys at

### Saturday 

* **Name**: Spanish Needle -3
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 92.0
* **NP**: 156
* **IF**: 78%

**Description**:

> Spanish Needle -3 is 6x8-minute sets of microbursts where you alternate
> between 15 seconds at 140% FTP and 15 seconds at 40% FTP. Recovery valleys
> between sets of bursts are just over 5 minutes long.
> 
> The first set of microbursts offers a ramping warmup which can help you
> determine any intensity reductions that might be necessary.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 2

> In a similar vein as microbursts, your first workout of week 2 consists of a
> few rounds of on/off intervals, this time performed at substantially lower but
> still highly challenging wattage. By keeping your breathing and heart rate
> high over the course of each set of short repeats, you'll accumulate
> tremendous aerobic benefit without the usual accompanying leg-searing pain and
> gasping agony of longer, sustained VO2max intervals.
> 
> Then, you'll face a set of over-unders only marginally tougher than last
> week's in that they ascend to a slightly higher power output before slowly,
> painfully dropping just below your FTP, all with the aim of improving your
> sustainable power.
> 
> Finally, the weekend brings with it this plan's first combination workout
> which addresses your ability to accelerate powerfully before settling into
> some strength endurance work, several times over, before capping each set with
> one final kick thereby addressing all of the energy systems necessary during a
> race-winning move.

* **TSS**: 103.0
* **NP**: 166
* **IF**: 83%

**Description**:

> Lion Rock is 3 sets of 3x5-minute Threshold efforts that begin with a
> 15-second sprint at 150% FTP and then settle in for 4 minutes at 95% FTP, aka
> "racewinners".
> 
> Each set finishes with a 30-second "kick to the line" in the form of a ramp
> from 95% FTP all the way up to 140% FTP.
> 
> Recoveries between intervals are only 1 minute long but recoveries between
> sets of intervals are each 10 minutes long.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 3

> Week 3 ups the intensity of last week's VO2max repeats which are identical in
> format but performed at a slightly higher percentage of your FTP. If you
> survived last week's workout, give this one a shot with no change in Workout
> Intensity. But if you struggled with the less-intense version of this workout,
> drop the intensity 5% and have another crack at success.
> 
> Then it's time for your last dance with over-unders which have again escalated
> their demand a bit - the peaks ascend more slowly locking you into a little
> more time above your FTP, repeatedly.
> 
> The week closes with some familiar racewinners followed by a few short rounds
> of microbursts. Thought they were tough already? Try 'em with a healthy dose
> of fatigue in your legs. Sounds sadistic, but roadies who learn to perform
> these tasks back-to-back will foster an ability to make their way into a break
> and then contest the inevitable infighting, while trail riders can further
> their ability to conquer wildly rolling courses or trails.

## Week 5

> It's highly likely your fitness has improved over the course of the first 4
> weeks of your Build conditioning. So you'll want to adjust your training zones
> accordingly and keep the challenges climbing right along with your
> capabilities. So Week 5 begins with another Ramp Test assessment workout, one
> you're welcome to swap for either the 20 Minute FTP Test or the 8 Minute FTP
> Test if you prefer.
> 
> Then it's on to your next VO2max progression where those comparatively short
> repeats become fewer in number but substantially longer in duration. But the
> intent remains the same: increasing the duration at your repeatable maximal
> aerobic power.
> 
> You'll finish out this week with a round of efforts that push you right up to
> your FTP's lower limit and hold you there as you reinforce your ability to
> churn out those high, steady watts.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 6

> Week 6 rearranges the front-loaded format you saw in the first few weeks of
> training due to the higher intensity of each week's opening workout. Ideally,
> this will help you get through the hardest workouts when you're freshest and
> keep each workout as productive as possible, starting with some descending
> anaerobic intervals. As the intensity rises, the durations fall in order to
> keep pushing your muscular capabilities without overly taxing them
> metabolically.
> 
> Then, you'll see a slight escalation in the duration of your VO2max intervals
> with the addition of another 30 seconds but a slight decrease in power output
> will help compensate. If you feel like you can handle the additional 30
> seconds at last week's 120% FTP, you're encouraged to step up the intensity
> even if you sensibly wait until the second or third set.
> 
> Finally, you'll endure another round of near-FTP repeats that total only
> slightly more work than you performed last week. If you relied on a couple
> backpedal breaks during last week's longer intervals, see if you can trim
> things down to a single break during these still-long, but not quite as long
> Threshold repeats.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 7

> Week 7's anaerobic/increasingly-aerobic repeats maintain their duration and
> intensity but grow a little less generous with their recovery. So even though
> the sets are shorter overall, you'll still repeat these high-power efforts the
> same number of times as last week, just with less available energy to support
> them.
> 
> Exactly like the suggestion made last week, this week's VO2max offering keeps
> the durations at 3 minutes and combines the slightly higher power of week 5's
> round of aerobic capacity repeats. So if you heeded that advice and made it
> work for you, consider another small jump in intensity during any number of
> this week's sets.
> 
> Finally, you'll wrap up your final General Build loading week with some truly
> long efforts only a little below your FTP which promise even greater muscle
> endurance (in a couple weeks). If you get a bit overwhelmed, sprinkle in as
> many as three of those short, 15-second breaks without succumbing to the
> temptation to indulge in more or longer backspins.

## Week 8

> Having made it through 7 tough weeks of General Build training, it's again
> time to rest up with a repeat of Week 4's recovery cycle.
> 
> By repeating your recovery weeks in nearly identical fashion, you're provided
> with an opportunity to modify your recovery workloads to fit your particular
> recovery profile. Did your last recovery week leave you feeling a bit too
> tired to dive back into training? Perhaps you didn't need quite as much rest
> as you were given.
> 
> In any case, similar recovery weeks provide a consistent protocol that can be
> altered as necessary such that you feel eager and rested heading into your
