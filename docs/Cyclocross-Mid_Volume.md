# Trainer Road Plan: Cyclocross Mid Volume

> The mid-volume version of the Cyclocross Training Plan has riders on the bike
> 4 times a week with optional Skill Work sessions done outdoors when possible.
> The total weekly stress for the 4 weekly rides will roughly range from 180-450
> TSS and weekly hours for these 4 bike workouts will range from 3 hours during
> Recovery/Taper/Peak weeks to 5 hours during Build weeks.
> 
> All Run workouts are simply recommendations that accommodate typical time
> constraints and favor quality & consistency over volume. Skill Work sessions
> are highly encouraged and additional sessions can take the place of a weekly
> Run workout. With the addition of regular Run workouts and Skills workouts,
> weekly hours will increase only by about 1.5 hours per week but this doesn't
> account for prep & travel time to outdoor courses.

## Week 1

> The first week of Base 1 jumps right into some relatively high-intensity
> intervals with numerous, small doses of VO2max work in a couple of different
> yet rather 'cross-specific formats. There's also some midweek Big Gear
> intervals aimed at improving your ability to recruit a lot of muscle when
> necessary, and some Tempo work will finish off the week.

## Week 2

> The second week of Base 1 slightly ups the demands of your Big Gear intervals
> as well as your early-week and weekend VO2max workouts. Try to dial in the
> proper Workout Intensity during your Billats workouts over these first 3 weeks
> as each week ups their wattage a bit. Once you've found that repeatable power
> output, focus on completing workouts without taking breaks before you consider
> lifting the intensity.The end-of-week Tempo ride is a replay of last week's
> and can be lengthened or even doubled if you have the time and feel it won't
> interfere with Monday's rest. Simply see to it that you feel ready to tackle
> Week 3, but feel free to add some Tempo work if you find yourself with a
> little extra time the end of the week.

## Week 4

> Week 4 of Base 1 will cut the workload way back while keeping both days of
> intensity intact but with reduced workloads. If you aren't performing Billats
> in one form or another, you're logging easy Endurance mileage and allowing
> your body to absorb the previous 3 week's training load. This week is about
> taking a step back in order to take a couple steps forward in Base 2, so while
> you want to maintain your training schedule, err on the side of caution when
> it comes to your Endurance hours by reducing their duration if that's what's
> necessary to emerge from this week fresh and motivated.

## Week 5

> Building on the work performed so far, the first week of Base 2 grows and
> varies the demand of your high-intensity intervals as the use of Reduced-
> Amplitude Billats is increased. Most of the float-periods remain at their
> ever-constant 15 seconds with the addition of some longer, 30-second floats to
> counter their intensity boost up to Sweet Spot while the Billats themselves
> increase their duration slightly. These may only be 5-second increases, but
> they are plentiful and add up to a noticeable increase in each workout's
> overall stress. The Big Gear intervals are replaced by a combination of Race
> Starts coupled with some more RAB's in order to familiarize your mind and body
> with the stress inherent in chasing your initial sprint with some real work.
> Your Tempo ride maintains its duration but it does so through the application
> of longer intervals this week.

> a leg over the bike for either of your Endurance rides, consider an extra day
> of full recovery on one of these days. Remember, the goal is to emerge from

## Week 9

> With 8 weeks of 'cross-specific base training in your body and/or residual
> fitness carried over from a recent race season, we'll continue escalating the
> work demands as they become even more specific to the demands of cyclocross
> racing. Week 1's Mixed Bag workout, which incidentally kick off each week of
> all 3 Build phases, keeps you guessing much the way your competitors will by
> varying how long you work and how long you 'rest' during each set of RAB's.
> Your Tempo ride now incorporates Race starts and a focus on increased time at
> your highest aerobic output (or a close approximation) comes in the form of
> 2-minute efforts with rest periods that get shorter each week as your aerobic
> power grows. Your end-of-week workout becomes increasingly stressful and will
> soon culminate in race simulations, and both weekend workouts can be switched

> before you rest and plan your weekend. It's crucial that you spend either/both
> of your weekend days racing when possible. If only one day is spent racing,

> you choose, but riders typically can't maintain peak form for longer than 4-6
> weeks. If you structured your training such that your top-priority event takes
> place this weekend, plan your rest accordingly. For example, if you race
> Saturday, perform Thursday's workout on Wednesday or skip it if back-to-back
> workouts might overcook you, rest Thursday and perform Saturday's workout on
> Friday. If you race Sunday though, simply leave the plan as it stands.
