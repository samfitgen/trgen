# Trainer Road Plan: Half Distance Triathlon Base - High Volume

> The high-volume version of the Half Distance Triathlon Base plan has
> triathletes swimming four times each week for up to 10,000m, on the bike 4
> times each week for up to 8 hours total (including a weekly brick workout),
> and frequently running around 4 hours each week.
> 
> This version is aimed at experienced half distance triathletes and evolving
> Olympic distance triathletes who have no real restrictions on training volume
> and know how their bodies respond to high levels of training stress. These
> triathletes are looking to finish in the top-tier of their age groups, with
> true ambitions of reaching the podium, and they’re willing and ready to train
> as much as 16 weekly hours.
> 
> Note: Double-day workouts can be done in any order and separated by as little
> or as much time as you choose, as long as you can keep the quality of both
> workouts high.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2000m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4; 12x25m CU
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 12x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 400m
> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Tuesday_   **FTP Assessment**  Get a solid estimate of your current fitness
> via the Ramp Test. You have the option of using the 8-minute FTP Test or the
> 20 Minute FTP Test if you prefer, just see to it that you reassess using the
> same workout each time.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2050m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 10x25m FS
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 11x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run** 45min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6, and since you may
> be coming back from a training layoff, you’re welcome to take 1 to 2-minute
> walk-breaks as often as necessary over the course of this run.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Brick Workout (Cumberland + 20min Transition Run)** Very much in
> line with the steady-state nature of a half distance triathlon’s bike leg,
> you’ll work very steadily for 60 minutes on the bike, in your aero position as
> often as possible, before dismounting, transitioning quickly into your running
> gear and hoofing it at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 for 20 minutes of heavy-leg
> running experience. Try not to let that initial lack of coordination
> discourage you - it will pass before you know it.
> 
> _Friday_ **Ericsson** Time to target leg speed with the aim of improving your
> pedal efficiency (or your ability to turn the pedals with the minimal amount
> of effort and energy). You’ll work in a narrow but highly productive power
> range that’s close enough to your FTP to get your mind and body ready for the
> more rigorous workouts to follow in later training phases but not a range
> that’s too taxing to prevent fairly rapid recovery.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (2000m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4; 12x25m F
> drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 4x150m of 50m Easy, RPE4/25m Hard, RPE8,
> 10s rest between intervals; 12x25m SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-
> Down 400m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Big Squaw** If you’re not doing a brick each weekend, steady
> mileage at a highly aerobic work rate will be the name of the game. Use these
> unrelenting, long stretches of time in the saddle to pack some fatigue into
> your slow-twitch fibers and grow their capabilities as a result. By lifting
> your aerobic capacity, you’ll become capable of working at higher percentages
> of your FTP while relying on less glycogen in the process - last longer, go
> faster, burn less sugar.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 30min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> then conclude your run with 4x20s controlled sprints, RPE10, preferably uphill
> w/ 40s of recovery between them. Keep the hill fairly tame such that you can
> run with a bit of speed and a fairly open stride, not too choppy.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2000m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 1500m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run for 65min at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. The
> goal here is steady, continuous mileage and a slower form of fatigue than
> you’ll see during your shorter base runs. Accordingly, reduce the intensity to
> 4 or 5RPE if it keeps your legs turning over, non-stop and injury-free.

### Monday 

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> 
> _Saturday_ **Town Hill** Steady mileage at a highly aerobic work rate is once

> continuous mileage and that slower form of fatigue, so reduce the intensity to
> RPE5 or RPE4 if it helps you keep running with fewer, ideally no walk-breaks.

## Week 4 (Recovery)

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1700m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4; 12x25m SC
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; Cool-Down 400m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Goddard** With even emphasis split between cultivating that high-
> end base for later improvements in FTP and form work aimed at improving your
> pedaling efficiency, this workout will expose any weaknesses in your pedaling
> action over the course of some relatively short intervals.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2100m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 6x50m K
> &R; Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 11x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run** Just a 35-minute Base Run at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6
> this week. If you’re using walk-breaks, you can lengthen them to 2 minutes
> this week. If you aren’t using them, feel welcome to add a couple 1-minute
> walks if the fatigue is pretty high during this recovery week.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Looking Glass** These 3 intervals will undulate between modest
> and mildly challenging levels of effort and split focus between aerobic
> improvements and muscular ones still aiming to improve your ability to burn
> fat for fuel and pull more oxygen from your bloodstream.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 40min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> trim it back down to 4x20s controlled sprints, RPE10, on your not-too-steep
> hill of choice or even keep these on flat terrain this week.
> 
> _Friday_ **Slide Mountain** Down at the lower end of the Sweet Spot range,
> these 3 efforts will tone things down enough to keep your endurance in check
> without wasting you for the weekend ahead.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (1700m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4; 8x25m BB
> drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 4x150m of 50m Build from RPE4 to RPE8/25m
> Descend from RPE8 to RPE4, 15s rest between intervals; Cool-Down 400m easy,
> RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Brick Workout (Pioneer + 20min Race-Pace Run)** This week will
> drop the bike duration back down a bit but increase the run duration. You’ll
> ride pretty steadily for 45 minutes, in your aero position as often as
> possible, then dismount and transition quickly into your running gear for 30
> minutes at a sub-race-pace effort. Get a feel for running longer than a short
> transition run and find your fluid-ish running style as soon as possible.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (1800m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 1200m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4.

> RPE6 pace.
