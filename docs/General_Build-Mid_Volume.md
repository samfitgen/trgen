# Trainer Road Plan: General Build - Mid Volume

> As the competitive season opens, a necessary shift from basic capabilities
> toward more specific ones takes place. This shift toward specificity is a
> little less pronounced in the type of training aimed at riders seeking to keep
> their events, and necessary capabilities, a bit broader.
> 
> So the overriding goal of the General Build plans is to place fairly even
> emphasis on Threshold training and its focus on extending your durations
> during efforts near your FTP, VO2max work and the ability to repeat hard
> efforts and often in quick succession, and anaerobic intervals aimed at
> increasing your repeatable, near-maximal power outputs.
> 
> We address the shorter, more intense efforts that can make or break a rider as
> the pace kicks up and more severe efforts come one after another while never
> neglecting the Threshold workouts that condition riders to periodically
> sustain near-FTP power output for reasonably long periods even following those
> briefer, high-intensity workloads.
> 
> This even combination of key workouts suits riders with more general
> aspirations and target events. All-around riders like stage racers - road or
> dirt - and competitors looking for multi-faceted fitness in everything from
> sprints to climbs to time trials need to administer frequent combinations of
> near-FTP output, high-end & repeatable aerobic power, and near-maximal bursts
> of speed. Evenly addressing all of these requirements is what the General
> Build plans are all about.

## Week 1

> First things first: time to assess improvement born out of your recent Base
> training plans allowing you to adjust your FTP, and with it, all of the power
> levels anchored to it. While the Ramp Test is scheduled, you're welcome to use
> the 20 Minute FTP Test or the 8 Minute FTP Test and utilize whichever format
> you prefer.
> 
> Up next, an atypically long aerobic Endurance ride containing a handful of
> late-workout sprints makes up some of the TSS missed during your assessment
> workout. Then, considering the suprathreshold nature of your assessment
> workout, the emphasis shifts to strength endurance as you face a muscle-
> depleting round of over-unders that challenge your ability to hold your power
> very close to your newly-elevated FTP for some fairly lengthy durations.
> 
> Once you've bounced back from your weekday workouts, your weekend begins with
> what might be your first exposure to microbursts via a few rounds of punchy
> efforts that address your neuromuscular and anaerobic power capabilities as
> well as your aerobic system's ability to support your attempts at repeating
> them over and over.  
> 
> Your first week of training closes out with some ol' fashioned, no-frills
> Sweet Spot repeats bent on lifting your sustained power capabilities in a
> gentler manner than less forgiving Threshold repeats. But if you want things
> even gentler (but longer), replace Antelope with Boarstone +3 or gentler (and
> longer) still, Town Hill.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

### Thursday 

* **Name**: Carpathian Peak
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 15 minutes
* **TSS**: 90.0
* **NP**: 170
* **IF**: 85%

**Description**:

### Saturday 

* **Name**: Spanish Needle -3
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 92.0

> with 5-minute recoveries between intervals.

## Week 2

> In a similar vein as microbursts, your first workout of week 2 consists of a
> few rounds of on/off intervals, this time performed at substantially lower but
> still highly challenging wattage. By keeping your breathing and heart rate
> high over the course of each set of short repeats, you'll accumulate
> tremendous aerobic benefit without the usual accompanying leg-searing pain and
> gasping agony of longer, sustained VO2max intervals.
> 
> Noodle through a shorter round of aerobic riding with a couple of sprints
> thrown in to keep your sprint sharp before you face a set of over-unders only
> marginally tougher than last week's in that they ascend to a slightly higher
> power output before slowly, painfully dropping just below your FTP, all with
> the aim of improving your sustainable power.
> 
> Finally, the weekend brings with it this plan's first combination workout
> which addresses your ability to accelerate powerfully before settling into
> some strength endurance work, several times over, before capping each set with
> one final kick thereby addressing all of the energy systems necessary during a
> race-winning move.
> 
> Wrap things up with another round of Sweet Spot repeats, ones that force you
> to employ an intermediate recovery such that you recognize the upside of
> keeping your legs only slightly fresher over the course of longer intervals.
> Again, go the longer/slower route by skipping Juneau in favor of something
> like Town Hill or Boarstone +3.

## Week 3

> Week 3 ups the intensity of last week's VO2max repeats which are identical in
> format but performed at a slightly higher percentage of your FTP, and it tacks
> some additional aerobic mileage in order to keep tomorrow's Endurance +
> Sprints ride a little less taxing and a bit more recuperative. If you survived
> last week's workout, give this one a shot with no change in Workout Intensity.
> But if you struggled with the less-intense version of this workout, drop the
> intensity 5% and have another crack at success.
> 
> Then it's time for your last dance with over-unders which have again escalated
> their demand a bit - the peaks ascend more slowly locking you into a little
> more time above your FTP, repeatedly.
> 
> The weekend starts with some familiar racewinners followed by a few short
> rounds of microbursts. Thought they were tough already? Try 'em with a healthy
> dose of fatigue in your legs. Sounds sadistic, but roadies who learn to
> perform these tasks back-to-back will foster an ability to make their way into
> a break and then contest the inevitable infighting, while trail riders can
> further their ability to conquer wildly rolling courses or trails.
> 
> And finally, square off against your longest round of Sweet Spot intervals yet
> as you keep that strength endurance continually challenged and ever-growing.
> This ride's intensity can be toned down a bit with the same options from the
> last couple weeks, Boarstone +3 or Town Hill. And of course, you're always
> welcome to get outdoors and amass the prescribed TSS in a more scenic
> environment.

## Week 5

> It's highly likely your fitness has improved over the course of the first 4
> weeks of your Build conditioning. So you'll want to adjust your training zones
> accordingly and keep the challenges climbing right along with your
> capabilities. Accordingly, Week 5 begins with another Ramp Test assessment
> workout, one you're welcome to swap for either the 20 Minute FTP Test or the 8
> Minute FTP Test if you prefer.
> 
> Then it's on to another temporarily lengthened Endurance/Sprint workout before
> moving on to your next VO2max progression where those comparatively short
> repeats become fewer in number but substantially longer in duration. But the
> intent remains the same: increasing the duration at your repeatable maximal
> aerobic power.
> 
> You'll start your weekend off with a trio of long, Threshold repeats that push
> you up to but not beyond your lactic tipping point and hold you there for some
> pretty long stretches. Then, you'll close week 5 with a longer, mish-mash ride
> where efforts range from short, all-out sprints to low-end Tempo repeats and
> everything in between. If you choose to do something longer and slower
> instead, consider Flattop since it includes a couple of early-workout sprints.

## Week 6

> Week 6 goes hard early on with a few rounds of descending anaerobic intervals.
> As the intensity rises, the durations of each interval fall in order to keep

> Then as usual, it's on to your midweek Endurance ride with a similar round of
> mid-workout sprints as last week's but with substantially less time in the
> saddle.
> 
> Then, you'll see a slight escalation in the duration of your VO2max intervals
> with the addition of another 30 seconds but a slight decrease in power output
> will help compensate. If you feel like you can handle the additional 30
> seconds at last week's 120% FTP, you're encouraged to step up the intensity
> even if you sensibly wait until the second or third set.
> 
> Over the course of your weekend's first workout, you'll endure another round
> of near-FTP repeats that total only slightly more work than you performed last
> week. If you relied on a couple backpedal breaks during last week's longer
> intervals, see if you can trim things down to a single break during these
> still-long, but not quite as long Threshold repeats.

## Week 7

> Week 7's anaerobic offering pushes you well beyond your FTP with fairly short
> efforts that are actually slightly longer than the short recovery valleys that
> immediately follow them. So while anaerobic were you to face them one at a
> time with ample rest in between, each set's minimally restful structure sees
> to it that this is very much a max aerobic workout.
> 
> Repeat last week's short, aerobic ride with the same handful of sprints aimed
> at keeping your jump meaningfully powerful, and then it's on to another round
> of VO2max repeats. And exactly like the suggestion made last week, this week's
> VO2max format keeps the durations at 3 minutes and combines a slightly higher
> power than week 5's round of aerobic capacity repeats. So if you made it
> through both weeks reasonably successfully, see if you can handle this small
> jump in intensity for both of this week's short sets.
> 
> Finally, you'll wrap up your final General Build loading week starting with
> some truly long efforts only a little below your FTP which promise even
> greater muscle endurance (in a couple weeks). If you get a bit overwhelmed,
> sprinkle in as many as three of those short, 15-second breaks without
> succumbing to the temptation to indulge in more or longer backspins.
> 
> Then you'll end this last week of work with one small evolution of the
> previous Sunday workouts as your group-ride simulation gets mildly more
> stressful. Again, feel free to ride longer and at lower intensity by using
> something like Big Mountain or Allegheny, or perhaps get outside and spend a
> few hours enjoying the outside world, maybe even throw in a few short, hard
> sprints.
