# Trainer Road Plan: Century - Low Volume

> The low-volume version of the Century specialty block consists of 3 rides each
> week which primarily address strength endurance but do so in a few different
> ways.  Long distance, steady-state riding relies largely on this ability to
> work at a high, steady percentage of FTP so the clear emphasis of this
> Specialty plan falls on strength endurance.  
> 
> This peak-fitness block uses a consistently progressed but interestingly
> varied approach to increase your ability to turn the pedals hard for long
> durations including some late-plan, high-intensity VO2max work - all in the
> hopes of maximizing a comparatively small amount of weekly riding and yielding
> big-training-budget rewards on a pretty low-time-budget schedule.  
> 
> So even riders with barely more than 4 hours per week can see gains that will
> lead to faster completion times, less discomfort in the saddle over these long
> hauls, and greater performance confidence tied to the improved fitness derived
> from this concentrated and specific ultra-distance conditioning block.

## Week 1

> Whether you just wrapped up a Sustained Power Build block or you're reaching
> this plan from a different avenue, getting a measure of your current fitness
> is the first order of business. Use the Ramp Test (or the 20 Minute FTP Test
> or 8 Minute FTP Test if that's your preference) to get an estimate of your
> sustainable power and help us anchor your training levels.  
> 
> Then, you'll have the opportunity to see if your estimated FTP is close to the
> mark as you work through some extended efforts just below your lactic tipping
> point. And in order to make up for the relatively low TSS accumulated during
> your assessment workout, the recovery valleys between these efforts are a
> little closer to Endurance watts than usual.
> 
> Finally, your first week finishes off with a healthy dose of Sweet Spot work
> aimed at furthering your ability to hold high percentages of your newly
> improved functional threshold power.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 2

> Week 2 begins with a reintroduction to 105's - efforts done far enough above
> your FTP to inspire increases in it, but repeats done far enough below your
> VO2max ceiling to allow durations substantially longer than most aerobic
> capacity repeats.  
> 
> Up next, another round of slightly subthreshold repeats totalling noticeably
> more work than you faced last week. Get used to working this close to your
> FTP, then any work spent farther below your threshold power will become more
> and more manageable and inflict far less muscle fatigue.
> 
> Again, your week wraps up with some endurance-extending Sweet Spot work done
> at only slightly higher intensities but substantially longer durations; same
> total time in the Sweet spot though.

## Week 3

> One more week of increasing demands separates you from a week of easy riding,
> and it starts with only a small escalation in the total duration of your
> 105's. They're a little shorter, but they're greater in number in hopes of
> further lifting your ability to sustain power above your FTP.  
>   
> Your final dose of Threshold work elevates both the interval duration as well
> as the workout's total time spent in that barely-below-FTP power range. But
> the fun doesn't stop there!  
>   
> Saturday brings on some downright intimidatingly long intervals in a good
> news/bad news scenario: only 2 intervals/they're each 30 minutes long. But by
> now you've employed a backpedal break or two (or you're a true machine) and
> have recognized them for the carrots they are. Use those carrots to keep you
> chugging along with sometimes just the promise of a short bail-out, but don't
> hesitate to include a couple of actual no-load breaks to keep you motivated
> and productive.

## Week 5

> In the event your sustainable power has increased, we'll want to adjust your
> training levels appropriately. So Week 5 begins with a Ramp Test or the
> optional 8 Minute FTP Test or 20 Minute Test based on whichever format helps
> you remain consistent over the course of your season.  
> 
> And just in case you thought you were done with VO2max work, your second
> workout kicks off a late-plan round of aerobic capacity work to help nudge up
> your sustainable power capabilities a little more prior to your most important
> event(s). By stressing your heart, lungs, and muscles briefly but intensely,
> you can find a little more room to allow your FTP to rise.
> 
> The first week in this second round of loading concludes with a return to some
> lower-end Sweet Spot work that is a bit more in line with the type of effort
> you may find yourself exerting over the course of your 100-mile events. And
> while you may seldom work this hard during your multi-hour endeavors, the
> muscle endurance cultivated here will only make your day more enjoyable and
> probably a bit faster.

### Sunday

## Week 6

> Week 6 starts by dialing down your 105's to 102's, but what's lost in
> intensity will be accounted for in either less recovery or greater interval
> duration. Regardless, the focus now is less on lifting your FTP as much as
> gradually lowering bodily fatigue over the course of these final weeks of
> training.
> 
> This isn't necessarily the case with your VO2max repeats, but one single high-
> intensity workout per week remains in the spirit of extracting some last-
> minute-fitness gains. Modify the workout intensity as necessary in order to
> fully but barely complete these relatively long high-capacity repeats.
> 
> Then cap off the week with another jump in your Sweet Spot interval durations
> as you put your ever-rising strength endurance to the test over some long but
> manageable efforts.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 7

> Only one week of hard work left, then it's onto a pre-event recovery week. To
> get things rolling, you'll work your way through one last round of slightly
> supra-FTP repeats that still stand a chance of lifting your FTP one last
> little bit, but will fortify your ability to dole out high, steady wattage
> regardless.
> 
> Up next is one last round of VO2max repeats that grow in duration yet again.
> Pushing your breathing and heart rate to a very high level and then keeping it
> there is the essence of VO2max work. The longer you stay there, the greater
> the training stimulus and the higher your post-recovery capabilities. Consider
> this the TrainerRoad ultimate in all 3 cases considering that you won't see
> VO2max intervals longer than these ones.
> 
> And then, it all wraps up with a return to Week 5's format, just at a slightly
> higher intensity. Again, the capability to ride at percentages this high for
> durations this long will have a resounding effect on all power levels below
> it. So as you work through this last round of Sweet Spot work, do so knowing
> that the longer you hang in there, the easier everything else will become by
> comparison.

## Week 8

> In lieu of a one- or two-week taper, this final week of recovery will
> generally suffice with regard to lowering your fatigue and raising your level
> of motivation and muscular freshness. If, however, you began a 2-week taper
> last week due to excessive fatigue (see week 7's _Week Tips_ ), consider
> reducing the duration of one or both of your weekday workouts.
> 
> In any case, your Saturday workout is simply a placeholder for your event,
> even if it falls on Sunday.
> 
> And if you're lively with energy, feel free to add a bit of intensity into any
> of this week's workouts with the addition of a couple of short, Sweet Spot
> efforts folded into the low-intensity riding that's prescribed. Something
> along the lines of a couple of 3- to 5-minute efforts at 85% FTP should
> suffice.
> 
> Most likely though, this week of easy mileage will be exactly what you need to
> feel rested and ready for the weekend's event. Good luck!
