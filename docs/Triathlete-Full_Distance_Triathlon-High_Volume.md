# Trainer Road Plan: Full Distance Triathlon - High Volume

> Establishing base fitness paves the way for workloads that are heaped higher &
> higher during build training. With both forms of conditioning buttoned up, the
> intent is now to top off your fitness, uncover a high level of freshness and
> lock down your confidence over these final 8 weeks of training.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base + Threshold Intervals (3400m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4;
> 12x25m SC Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 7x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 45s rest between
> intervals; 12x25m K &R drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 400m easy,
> RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Ramp Test** It's pretty likely you've seen some improvement over
> the course of your Build phase, so we'll begin this specialized training phase
> by reassessing your FTP such that the final weeks leading up to your most
> important races are appropriately demanding and as productive as possible. Use
> the same test format you've used before, and make sure you feel rested and
> motivated heading into this workout.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (3300m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4; 6x50m F
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x200m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 10s rest
> between intervals; 8x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals;
> Cool-Down 400m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 10min working up to Easy-Moderate,
> RPE 6 pace to warm up, then shoot for 5x4-minute Hard, RPE9 high-speed surges
> with 4 minutes of recovery after each followed by 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool
> down for about 55 minutes of running.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Brick Workout** Polar Bear + 60min Base Run: Begin with a 2-hour
> bike workout where you'll sustain 1hr45min of effort between 80-85% FTP before
> transitioning into a 60-minute run at an Easy-Moderate RPE6 pace for a
> demanding but not overly taxing run off the bike,
> 
> _Friday_ **Townsend** Each of the 8 weeks ahead is likely to end in this
> workout or one very similar to it. Use this ride to accumulate a little extra
> aerobic endurance work, to practice and refine your aero positioning, and to
> keep your muscles pliable and reasonably refreshed. And always feel free to
> trim the duration of this workout if you recognize that you're carrying too
> much fatigue into a demanding weekend of training.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Base + VO2max + Speed Intervals (3350m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy,
> RPE4; 12x25m FS Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6

> 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 400m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Mianzimu** Having finished up with a 5-hour endurance ride during
> your Build training, this first long ride is simply a repeat of that same
> workout with the twin goals of keeping your aerobic endurance in place and
> further familiarizing you with the many challenges that accompany these long,
> steady-effort rides.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Recovery Run** Later in the day, run 45 minutes at an Easy, RPE
> 4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Swim Time Trial (3900m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE 4; 3200m Hard, RPE
> 9; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Repeat your longest run to date by running 2hr50min
> at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6 pace.

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!
