# Trainer Road Plan: Sprint Triathlon Base - Mid Volume

> The mid-volume version of the Sprint Triathlon Base plan has triathletes
> swimming 3 times each week for up to 5500m, on the bike three times each week
> for up to 3 hours total (including a couple brick workouts), and running up to
> 2 hours weekly.
> 
> This 4-week plan is aimed at mildly experienced, multisport athletes looking
> to improve upon previous sprint triathlon results. The primary aim is to
> provide base fitness in all 3 disciplines, but this slightly higher-volume
> plan - 7.5 hours per week at its peak - aims for a higher level of performance
> than the low-volume plan.
> 
> Note: Double-day workouts can be done in any order and separated by as little
> or as much time as you choose, as long as you can keep the quality of both
> workouts high.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_   **FTP Assessment**  Get a solid estimate of your current fitness
> via the Ramp Test, or if you prefer, the 20 Minute FTP Test or the 8 Minute
> FTP Test. Whichever format you choose, try to use that format for every FTP
> assessment workout you perform.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base + Sprint Intervals (1550m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 4x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 8x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 6x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Run 35min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> randomly insert 6x30s bursts of high speed, RPE9 over the course of the run
> with at least 1 minute of recovery between bursts.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Goddard -4** With equal emphasis split between forming high-end
> base for later improvements in FTP and form work aimed at improving your
> pedaling efficiency, this workout will expose any weaknesses in form while
> introducing short-duration strength-endurance intervals that target your
> ability to sustain speed and power to the pedals.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals + Sprints (1800m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m FS Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x150m of 50m Easy, RPE4/25m Hard,
> RPE8, 15s rest between intervals; 4x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest
> between sprints; 6x25m SK Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m
> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 35min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and then
> conclude run with 2x20s controlled sprints, RPE10, preferably uphill w/ 40s of
> recovery between them.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Tunnabora** While keeping your watts in a narrow and reasonably
> high range, you’ll again target both your ability to sustain a high percentage
> of your FTP while also addressing how fluidly and quickly you turn the pedals.
> This is where your ability to ride a little above your FTP for 20km/12mi
> begins.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 35min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. If necessary, walk
> briefly, no more than a minute at a time, if it means the difference between
> running well and sacrificing form while running efficiency suffers. Quick
> walking breaks of a single minute can often keep the form high while costing
> very little in terms of aerobic fitness improvements.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (1300m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 800m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4.

### Monday 

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> _Thursday_ **Monitor -4** This bike workout is pretty straightforward as it
> lifts the Sweet Spot duration to 6 minutes at a time this week while trimming
> the recoveries to a scant 2 minutes. If you find yourself underchallenged by

> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 40min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Just a slight bump in
> run duration this week and you’re still encouraged to insert brief, 1-minute
