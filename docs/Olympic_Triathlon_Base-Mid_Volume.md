# Trainer Road Plan: Olympic Triathlon Base - Mid Volume

> The mid-volume version of the Olympic Triathlon Base plan has triathletes
> swimming three times each week for up to 6000m, on the bike three times each
> week for about 3.5 hours total (including a few brick workouts), and running
> up to 3 hours each week.
> 
> This happy-medium plan is aimed at reasonably experienced Olympic-distance
> triathletes, or even very experienced sprint distance triathletes, ready to
> move up to the international distance. This plan is designed to help athletes
> develop a firm base of fitness in all 3 disciplines, in preparation for
> potential top-10 age group placings, on no more than 8 hours per week.
> 
> Note: Double-day workouts can be done in any order and separated by as little
> or as much time as you choose, as long as you can keep the quality of both
> workouts high.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_   **FTP Assessment**  Get a solid estimate of your current fitness
> via the Ramp Test. You have the option of using the 8-minute FTP Test or the
> 20 Minute FTP Test if you prefer, just see to it that you reassess using the
> same workout each time.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1600m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 8x25m CU
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 8x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m
> easy, RPE.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run** 40min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Feel free to
> insert 1 minute of walking whenever necessary as you try to run more
> continuously from week to week and emphasize quality over quantity at this
> early point in your running. Try to run for at least 10 minutes between
> walking breaks if possible.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Shasta** Time to build some capacity! In particular, strength. By
> drilling it for a short 20 seconds at a time, your muscles will receive a
> loud-and-clear request for more - more muscle, more work, more power. This is
> true, on-the-bike strength work that will not only lift your ability to power
> the pedals for short durations but also much, much longer ones.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed + Sprint Intervals (1800m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m F drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m of 25m Easy, RPE4/25m Hard,
> RPE8, 10s rest between intervals; 4x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest
> between sprints; 8x25m K drills w/15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m
> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 40min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and then
> conclude your run with two 20-second controlled sprints, RPE10, preferably
> uphill w/ 40 seconds of recovery between them. Keep the grade gentle enough
> that you can generate a bit of speed and maintain fluid form, even up a hill.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Antelope** 50 total minutes of endurance work comprise your
> weekend ride as you face fairly long intervals, and quite a few of them.
> Fortunately, the recovery between each interval is pretty generous in the
> interest of keeping the steady, endurance-building watts comin’ for each of
> the 5 intervals.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (1600m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 1000m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 45min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Again, walk briefly
> when necessary if it means the difference between running well and sacrificing
> form while running efficiency suffers. Quick walking breaks of a single minute
> can often keep the form high while costing very little in terms of aerobic
> fitness improvements.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> 
> _Thursday_ **Shasta** In what will be a standard strength workout for a couple
> more weeks, try to improve on last week 's workout quality by dialing in your
> highest, repeatable 20-second power such that you bury yourself each time yet
> maintain pretty even power from the first interval to the last. If you feel

### Sunday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Base Run
* **Duration**: 2 days and 2 hours


**Description**:

> 50min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6, still working toward a non-stop run as long
> as your form remains fully intact over the entire course of your run. If not,
> walk briefly and rekindle your form for another steady stretch of running.

#### Workout 2
* **Name**: Continuous Base Swim


**Description**:

> Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4 1000m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 Cool-Down 300m Easy, RPE4

## Week 5

> _Tuesday_ **Baird -1** Time to jump right back into the rough stuff, even
> during base, and develop some high-end power as you target both leg speed and
> leg strength for one intense minute at a time. Think of VO2max work as pulling
> your power up from the top, while the later Sweet Spot workouts push your
> endurance up from the bottom.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1900m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 8x25m SA
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 9x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 8x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m
> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run** 50min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6, still walking
> briefly if/when necessary to encourage the highest level of form and
> efficiency as possible while still building a decent level of run endurance.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Tray Mountain** How 's a little 3x20 Sweet Spot workout sound for
> your midweek ride? How's spending at least half of each interval in your aero
> position sound? How's 20 minutes of continuous pedaling, 3 times in a row
> sound? It all sounds great if eventually smashing a 40k bike leg and setting a
> new PR in the process is on your agenda. Get to it.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed + Sprint Intervals (2000m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m SC drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 8x100m of 25m Easy, RPE4/25m Hard,
> RPE8, 15s rest between intervals; 4x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest
> between sprints; 8x25m SK drills w/15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m
> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 45min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and then
> conclude your run with 4x20-second controlled sprints, RPE10, back on that
> same or similar hill w/ 40 seconds of recovery between them. You 're welcome
> to extend this workout by 1 or 2 uphill stride efforts if you're confident it
> won't prolong your recovery.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Galena** You 've done this one before so now it's time to do it
> better. In one way or more, improve upon this second iteration of Galena by
> (choose one or more) spending more time aero, lifting your cadence a bit,
> holding steadier power, or perhaps holding slightly higher power over the
> course of some or all of these 20-minute repeats.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (1900m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 1200m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 60min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Keep working on
> reducing the number and/or duration of your walking breaks if you 're still
> using them, but don't hesitate to utilize them when necessary. Especially
> during training, but even during a race, they can make a tremendous impact on
> the quality of your performance.

## Week 6

> _Tuesday_ **Shortoff -1** Still targeting high-end power via increased leg
> speed and strength, this last base week’s VO2max offering extends the interval
> duration to 2 minutes each. If this requires a drop in the intensity, try
> these intervals as low as 110% FTP and then see if you can increase that
> percentage over the course of the workout. Maybe you can, maybe 110% is hard
> enough; in either case, use these intervals to grow your ability to withstand
> short-term pain as you increase your aerobic power.

> only effort of the day and don’t get ahead of yourself. Make each one high-
> quality, mostly or entirely aero, and maybe even consider making those small

> by-side comparison.
