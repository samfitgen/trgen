# Trainer Road Plan: 40k TT - Low Volume

> The 40k TT plans will prepare you for longer, more sustained efforts at higher
> percentages of functional threshold power (FTP). We know this type of fitness
> as muscular endurance. Growing muscular endurance is synonymous with building
> stamina. By increasing both your maximum steady-state power and stamina,
> you'll be able to work harder for longer durations.
> 
> If you're pursuing a 40-kilometer time trial or looking to increase your
> maximum steady-state power (aka your highest sustainable power), you should
> follow the 40k TT plan after you've completed your Base and Build phase plans.

## Week 1

> Your specialized training begins with a Ramp Test, but remain consistent with
> your assessment protocol of choice. If you've been loyal to either the 8
> Minute FTP Test or the 20 Minute FTP Test, consider this an opportunity to
> perform one or two steady-state efforts in your time trial position while
> refining your pacing capabilities.  
> 
> Following a day’s recovery, active or otherwise, the second workout of this
> first week will repeatedly expose you to work done slightly above your newly
> estimated FTP. The aim here is to subtly lift your time-trial power, but just
> as importantly, to help you adjust to mildly-suprathreshold work performed in
> your aero position.
> 
> Following another day’s recovery, your week closes with your first of 3
> practice time trials. This challenging workout utilizes a consistent pre-TT
> warmup format and then provides several more learning opportunities - proper
> pacing, working in position, the challenge of steady output - over 4 near-
> continuous segments at commonly utilized 40k power percentages.
> 
> And feel free to look for +/- versions of your scheduled practice time trial
> should you wish to increase or decrease the severity of the workout.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

**Description**:

> Dunderberg -1 is 56 minutes of near-steady output comprised of 4x14-minute
> segments ranging from 95-102% FTP each separated by short, 1-minute
> recoveries.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 2

> With a renewed sense of where your highest steady-state power currently
> resides, it’s time to spend some pretty long stretches of time targeting the
> ability to apply steady power while in your aero position. By increasing this
> particular form of stamina, you'll reduce the likelihood of breaking position
> and sacrificing precious time as your time trials enter their third and fourth
> quarters.
> 
> Your second interval workout of the week introduces you to a new workout
> format that offers continuous but mildly varied effort levels all done near
> your time trial power but far enough below it that you're never crushed under
> its stress. These 'progression workouts' are both highly effective at
> increasing your endurance near FTP, but also underscore the importance of
> starting conservatively and increasing your effort gradually as the workout or
> race progresses.
> 
> Week 2 closes out with a longer round of slightly suprathreshold repeats that
> are once again to be performed in your time trial position whenever possible.
> If this level of intensity prevents you from riding low, an important decision
> has to be made: modify your position or accept a lower power output and slower
> finish time than your fitness actually supports.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 3

> Week 3 begins with another round of stamina-reinforcing Sweet Spot intervals
> performed in your aero position. Their duration drops noticeably, but the
> addition of another repeat brings your total work time up a bit higher than
> last week - more time down low, but more manageable durations to balance
> things out.
> 
> Then, your slightly supra-FTP repeats move back to midweek, shrink in number
> and total duration, but grow individually. The aim here is to accustom you to
> longer stretches of time where you slightly exceed your sustainable power in
> order to grow that power a bit, but also to force you to work hard and still
> aerodynamically. These efforts also demonstrate the danger of remaining above
> your FTP longer than you should.
> 
> Then it's time for another dress rehearsal! This time, the segments are
> slightly shorter but every other aspect of the workout remains very much the
> same. Use this opportunity to refine week 1's performance in some way, be it a
> minor change in bike fit, less time out of position, or maybe even try out a
> slight change in body position.
> 
> Again, you're encouraged to look for +/- versions of your scheduled practice
> time trial should you wish to increase or decrease the severity of the
> workout.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 4

> The fourth week of your specialty plan probably finds you fatigued and longing
> for a bit of a break from the intensity. Some athletes need a recovery stretch
> every 3 weeks while some can wait until that 5th week, most riders see a
> decline in performance after 3 consistent weeks of loading. Dial things back
> for a few days, try to place an added emphasis on your sleep if possible
> (shoot for an extra hour a few nights this week), and do your best to avoid
> unnecessary stress or excessive physical activity.
> 
> Due to the low-volume nature of this particular plan, we won't dedicate the
> _entire_ week  to recovery but will use the final workout of the week (one you
> can shift to Sunday if you'd like an additional day's recovery) as another FTP
> assessment/practice TT. Within this specific cycling discipline, even subtle
> changes in FTP need to be accounted for due to the tight wattage range of
> these TT-specific workouts.
> 
> Assuming you're feeling rested and ready by the weekend, suit up and bang out
> a short 20-minute, all-out effort. And this time, full TT garb is recommended.
> If at all possible, kit up, all the way up. Don your skinsuit, your shoe
> covers, aero helmet, sunglasses or visor of choice, anything and everything
> you have at your disposal and plan to utilize on race day. You might consider
> an extra fan, as well.

* **Duration**: 1 hour
* **TSS**: 80.0
* **NP**: 178
* **IF**: 89%

**Description**:

> Following a full 30 minutes of warm-up, a 20-minute time trial is used to
> assess Functional Threshold Power (FTP) and Lactate Threshold Heart Rate
> (LTHR).
> 
> This workout can also serve as a workout in its own right and will target
> muscular endurance and effective pacing over a somewhat extended duration.
> 
> Use any cadence that suits you, but if you're pedaling slower than 80rpm it's
> in your best interest to increase your cadence over the course of your
> training.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 5

> The second half of this Specialty plan keeps the weekly stress similar to the
> first half, both of which are a substantial decline from the TSS you faced
> during your Build plan. This allows riders the chance to gradually unearth
> fitness buried beneath the fatigue of the Build phase as they hone said
> fitness to be as specific as possible to their key event; in this case, a
> near-FTP, steady-state effort.
> 
> Although FTP improvements aren't a key focus at this point in the training
> progression, any improvements in FTP **will** make a measurable impact on your
> performance capabilities since you'll then be working at higher power outputs
> over the course of these final 4 weeks and beyond. It never gets easier, you
> only  get faster, right?  
> 
> You'll start with another round of _Threshold_ + efforts just a skosh above
> your maximum steady-state power. As you probably guessed, the primary aim is
> to eke out any last, little increases in your FTP while the secondary aim is
> to confirm your ability to work in close proximity to that FTP while remaining
> low and narrow: aero.
> 
> Then, your Sweet Spot repeats grow a little in duration with a similar aim, to
> increase your time to exhaustion at effort levels very close to your time
> trial power.
> 
> Finally, your penultimate practice TT matches you against a full hour's worth
> of effort with even shorter breaks than usual, ideally, all spent entirely in
> your aero position. And yet again, you're welcome to seek out an alternative
> version of your scheduled practice TT should you wish to alter the overall
> demand of the workout.

## Week 6

> Just one week separates you from the blessed training reduction that is your
> 2-week taper, and it brings no surprises with its familiar mix of workouts and
> steady-TSS total. Week 6 begins with the last of your relatively long Sweet
> Spot workouts that is lighter than last week's in order to make up for some
> heavier stress you'll face later this week.
> 
> Up next, another progression workout that mildly lifts its demands over the
> ones you faced several weeks back. In addition to the strength-endurance
> benefit on offer, this workout is yet another opportunity to reinforce the
> night and day difference between going out conservatively versus going out too
> hard.  
> 
> Finally, one more weekend foray into slightly-suprathreshold territory where
> the efforts bump back up to their longer duration as the recovery valleys
> remain just long enough to keep the quality high from interval to interval. By
> now, these should be performed entirely in your aero position with perhaps the
> occasional break to stand for a few pedalstrokes or to grab a quick drink
> should you plan to carry a bottle.

## Week 7

> Week 7 is the first of 2 taper weeks that sees a sharp drop in training volume
> but no change in intensity. This format works really well on its own as a

> Speaking of which, your weekend provides you with one final opportunity to
> really nail things down, both in terms of race prep as well as execution. Feel
> free to include everything from arrival time and trainer setup (unless you're
> warming up on the road), pre-race nutrition and hydration, a bathroom break,
> your warmup, another bathroom break--you get the idea. Remove **all** of the
> mystery surrounding what might happen on race day save for those things beyond

> 
> Saturday is an  _openers_ workout based on a Sunday time trial, but if your TT
