# Trainer Road Plan: 40k TT - High Volume

> The 40k TT plans will prepare you for longer, more sustained efforts at higher
> percentages of functional threshold power (FTP). We know this type of fitness
> as muscular endurance. Growing muscular endurance is synonymous with building
> stamina. By increasing both your maximum steady-state power and stamina,
> you'll be able to work harder for longer durations.
> 
> If you're pursuing a 40-kilometer time trial or looking to increase your
> maximum steady-state power (aka your highest sustainable power), you should
> follow the 40k TT plan after you've completed your Base and Build phase plans.

## Week 1

> Your specialized training begins with a Ramp Test, but remain consistent with
> your assessment protocol of choice. If you've been loyal to either the 8
> Minute FTP Test or the 20 Minute FTP Test, consider this an opportunity to
> perform one or two steady-state efforts in your time trial position while
> refining your pacing capabilities.  
> 
> After an atypically long, midweek Endurance ride, your next key workout of
> this first week will be an actual practice time trial and a good opportunity
> to grasp whether or not your estimated FTP is in line with your time-trial
> power. This also serves as an introduction to pacing a long, near-continuous
> effort and a chance to address any bike fit issues that might limit your
> ability to lay down some high, steady-state power for a duration approaching
> your intended 40k time.
> 
> Following a short, low-intensity, aerobic endurance ride, your weekend begins
> with a dose of intervals that will repeatedly expose you to work done slightly
> below your newly estimated FTP, all in the same vein of this week's primary
> intent: reinforce your time trial stamina. This first week then closes with
> your first 'progression workout' which offers two rounds of continuous but
> mildly varied effort levels all done near your time trial power. This workout
> format can be highly effective at increasing your endurance near FTP but also
> underscores the importance of starting conservatively and increasing your
> effort gradually as the workout or race progresses.  
> 
> If you'd rather ride long and easy on Sunday, you can accumulate the same
> level of TSS in a lower-intensity manner by riding Koip, Laurentian, or by
> heading outdoors for a matched-TSS ride done between 60-75% FTP.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

**Description**:

> Rendezvous +3 is 2x40 minutes of continuous progression from 60-80% FTP and
> then 80% all the way up to 100% FTP via 10% increases every 10 minutes.

## Week 2

> Week 2 begins with your first round of slightly suprathreshold repeats that
> will ideally be performed in your time trial position whenever possible. If
> this level of intensity prevents you from riding low, an important decision
> has to be made: modify your position or accept a lower power output and slower
> finish time than your fitness actually supports.  
> 
> Up next, your midweek Endurance ride trims down to a shorter duration allowing
> you to spin off some of yesterday's fatigue. If you're yearning for some
> riding done in an upright position, today is a good time to take a break from
> aero work.
> 
> Then, your second practice TT lifts the workout duration slightly by extending
> each pacing quadrant by a single minute, but the short recoveries within the
> workout grow a little to compensate. If you'd rather face a single,
> uninterrupted TT effort, look for other versions of your scheduled practice
> TT. In any case, the goal here is to increase your aero-position muscle
> stamina and reduce the likelihood of breaking position and sacrificing
> precious time as your time trials enter their third and fourth quarters.
> 
> Following another Friday aerobic spin, you'll first spend some manageably long
> stretches of time targeting the ability to apply steady power down low and
> only slightly below your FTP. Working this close to your threshold power
> carries all the benefits of riding right at FTP, but does so with a somewhat
> lighter toll on your mind and muscles.
> 
> You'll close out this second week with another progression workout that tacks
> on a couple minutes to each wattage step making this workout a double dose of
> the type of stress you'll face on race day. Knowing you can all but repeat
> your goal duration even at lower intensities, goes a long way toward building
> the confidence necessary to hurt steadily for the better part of an hour.
> 
> Your lower-intensity options this week are Big Squaw and Ptarmigan, and of
> course, an outdoor ride with a similar TSS via watts in that 60-75% FTP range.

## Week 3

> Week 3 begins with another round of slightly suprathreshold repeats only
> slightly longer in duration than last week's, but the overall workload is
> barely heftier than last time. The aim here is to subtly lift your time-trial
> power, but just as importantly, to help you adjust to mildly-suprathreshold
> work performed in your aero position.
> 
> Following a short, easy day in the saddle, one you're welcome to perform in an
> upright position if you'd like, you'll endure your longest practice TT yet. By
> now you've likely recognized that these workouts utilize a consistent pre-TT
> warmup format and then provide several more learning opportunities - proper
> pacing, working in position, the challenge of steady output - over 4 near-
> continuous segments at commonly utilized 40k power percentages. This one
> differs slightly by offering exposure to a 5-segment time trial in order to
> illustrate one of many alternative pacing strategies.
> 
> Spin off some post-TT fatigue, then your weekend then begins with another
> round of stamina-reinforcing Threshold intervals performed in your aero
> position. Their duration drops a bit, but the addition of another repeat
> brings your total work time up a bit higher than last week - more time down
> low, but more manageable durations to balance things out.
> 
> You'll close out this third week of overload with the longest progression
> workout of this training phase which amounts to nearly two hours of steady-
> state work all but guaranteeing a couple of efforts about as long as the one
> you'll face in competition.
> 
> Lower/longer options this week? Try Big Mountain, Tenaya, or head outdoors.

## Week 5

> The second half of this Specialty plan keeps the weekly stress similar to the
> first half. This allows riders the chance to gradually unearth fitness buried
> beneath the fatigue of the Build phase as they hone said fitness to be as
> specific as possible to their key event; in this case, a near-FTP, steady-
> state effort.
> 
> Although FTP improvements aren't a key focus at this point in the training
> progression, any improvements in FTP  **will**  make a measurable impact on
> your performance capabilities since you'll then be working at higher power
> outputs over the course of these final 4 weeks and beyond. It never gets
> easier, you only get faster, right?
> 
> So you'll start with another FTP assessment. Again, perform this effort in
> your aero position, and if you choose to utilize either the 8 Minute FTP Test
> or the 20 Minute FTP Test, pace just like you'd pace the longer efforts (see a
> "Four-Quarters" breakdown in the  _Week Tips_ ), and see if you've raised your
> FTP.
> 
> Then, following an easy midweek Endurance ride, you'll face yet another
> practice TT to further refine your position, pacing and focus while also
> reinforcing your time trial stamina, all for just a minute longer than last
> time and returning to a 4-quarter pacing routine. Consider fully kitting up,
> all the way up. Don your skinsuit, shoe covers, aero helmet, sunglasses or
> visor of choice. Anything and everything you have at your disposal and plan to
> utilize on race day. You might consider an extra fan as well.
> 
> And feel free to look for +/- versions of your scheduled practice time trial
> should you wish to increase or decrease the severity of the workout.  
> 
> Come the weekend, your Threshold repeats grow a little in duration as the
> recoveries shrink a bit, all with the aim of increasing your time to
> exhaustion at effort levels very close to your time trial power. Then you'll
> repeat the same progression workout you faced in week 2 to close out this
> fifth week of specialization.
> 
> Milder but longer ride options this week are that same as week 2: Big Squaw,
> Ptarmigan or head outdoors.

## Week 6

> Just one week separates you from the blessed training reduction that is your
> 2-week taper and brings no surprises with its familiar mix of workouts and
> steady-TSS total. Week 6 begins with your longest set of  _Threshold+_
> efforts just a skosh above your maximum steady-state power. As you probably
> guessed, the primary aim is to eke out any last, little increases in your FTP
> while the secondary aim is to confirm your ability to work in close proximity
> to that FTP while remaining low and narrow: aero.
> 
> Following a very easy, very short recovery spin, you'll head into the longest
> practice TT you'll face over this entire 8-week training plan. Draw
> encouragement from the promise that an hour-long time trial ridden outdoors
> simply won't be as hard as this indoor sufferfest. Get through this one, and
> practically everything else will pale in comparison.
> 
> Again, feel free to look for a continuous version of the scheduled practice
> time trial should you wish to increase the severity and specificity of the
> workout.  
> 
> Spin out the heaviness on Friday, then one more weekend foray into slightly-
> subthreshold territory where the efforts grow to their longest duration, but
> so do their recovery valleys which are aimed at keeping your work quality high
> from interval to interval. By now, these should be performed entirely in your
> aero position with perhaps the occasional break to stand for a few
> pedalstrokes or grab a quick drink should you plan to carry a bottle.  
> 
> Finally, another progression workout that returns to week 3's highly demanding
> requirements. Given the work you've already done this week, you might feel
> entitled to a lighter version of this brand of workout to close out this final
> week of overload, but there'll be no rest for the dedicated, not yet. In
> addition to the strength-endurance benefit on offer, this workout is a couple
> more opportunities to reinforce the night and day difference between going out
> conservatively vs. too hard.
> 
> The lower-intensity options are the same as week 3 with Big Mountain and
> Tenaya as pretty close TSS equivalents if you choose to stay inside.  A
> similar-TSS ride with watts in the 60-75% FTP range is sufficient if you
> venture outdoors.

> day save for those things beyond your control and find it that much easier to
> remain calm, focused and eager to have your best day of the season.

> Rendezvous +1 is 2x30 minutes of continuous progression from 60-80% FTP and
> then 80% all the way up to 100% FTP via 10% increases every 10 minutes.

## Week 8

> Here it is, the final week leading up to and into your all-important race of
> truth.
> 
> Things kick off with another round of volume reductions in both your slightly
> suprathreshold intervals, which have shrunk down to their shortest durations
> yet, as well as your Threshold repeats. If you feel like this isn't enough
> work to sustain your fitness, don't worry,  **it is**. Your aim  over these
> final two weeks is not to try to elevate your fitness, but to uncover it by
> removing any last bit of fatigue that could limit your race performance.
> 
> Saturday is an  _openers_  workout based on a Sunday time trial, but if your
> TT falls on Saturday, perform the short priming workout on Friday instead. If
> you'd prefer a different openers workout, take a look at Truuli -2 or find
> something similar in format and TSS.
> 
> If for some reason you aren't racing this weekend, it's a good idea to slot in
> a repeat of one of your practice TT's in place of an outdoor race.
> 
> Beyond that, consider the work  **done**. Draw confidence from the fact you’ve
> put forth all that’s necessary to have a great race  and recognize that there
> is absolutely no need to cram any last-minute sessions into your schedule -
> they'll only work against you. Get out there, have a great day, and good luck!
