# Trainer Road Plan: Short Track Cross-Country - Low Volume

> The demands of Short Track Cross-Country racing blend many of the elements of
> mountain bike XC racing with those of road criterium racing. This mix of
> necessary proficiencies demands a rider who can maintain extremely high levels
> of sustained power peppered with even more severe surges, sprints and
> explosive accelerations, all on varied terrain.
> 
> The aim of every version of our STXC plans is to cultivate maximum aerobic
> power and combine it with high-level endurance and a rather extreme ability to
> frequently repeat incredibly high-output efforts.

## Week 1

> In order to get a handle on any recent improvements to your fitness, your
> first workout is the requisite FTP assessment in the form of our Ramp Test to
> allow us to scale your power levels appropriately. If you've used another
> assessment format, continue to use the same one in order to maintain
> consistency but also because it can serve as an effective Threshold/VO2max
> workout.  
> 
> Ideally, you'll have a day or two of recovery in your legs and will feel ready
> to fairly demonstrate your current level of fitness. If not, consider riding
> easy today and postponing your assessment until tomorrow.  
> 
> Then, it's onto a cluster of repeats at roughly that same suprathreshold power
> output, but for shorter and more frequent chunks of time. Working above your
> lactic tipping point is an excellent way to stress your maximum aerobic
> capabilities and to tax your mind's ability to tolerate a form of discomfort
> that's very much a part of short track XC racing.
> 
> Your week closes out with a round of hard-start intervals that combine a high-
> power push with some sustained effort done very close to your threshold power.
> These are close approximations of the combination of efforts frequently
> encountered over the course of a mass-start race as well as any course with
> punchy climbs or corners.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

Rest Day

## Week 2

> Your second week of race conditioning introduces (or more likely,
> reintroduces) you to some atypical VO2max intervals. These are unusual only in
> the sense that you won't encounter them in too many training plans, but you'll
> surely deal with this combination of efforts when racing short track. It's
> important to be able to repeat short, highly powerful surges and then resist
> the urge to let your power fall too far between accelerations. Get on it, stay
> on it.
> 
> Then, your less abusive but no less challenging repeats well above FTP grow a
> bit in duration in order to increase your ability to repeat efforts a little
> tougher than Threshold repeats but not quite as tough as ones performed at
> shorter, more traditional VO2max durations. But the ability to drive your
> power this high, hold it, and repeat it, will have a direct impact on the
> quality of riders who can hold your wheel for any length of time.
> 
> Finally, it's onto a near repeat of last weekend's Sprint + Threshold repeats
> where the emphasis marginally shifts to improving your sprint power but
> doesn't lose sight of the necessity to hold your post-sprint watts high.

## Week 3

> This week's VO2max + Sweet Spot repeats incorporate slightly lower power
> outputs into slightly longer sets and place just a touch more emphasis on your
> stamina than on your high-power capabilities. If you feel up to the challenge,
> you're welcome to nudge up the intensity if you're feeling underchallenged as
> the sets stack up.  
>   
> Then, your suprathreshold endurance work reaches its peak durations while
> keeping the total workout volume very steady. While it may be a wash in terms
> of overall stress, you may find that these longer durations are surprisingly
> more difficult. But so will every rider trailing in your wake out on the
> racecourse.  
>   
> Your final, pre-recovery-week set of hard-start, muscle-endurance intervals
> repeats last weekend's change and lifts the opening sprint's demands even
> higher. This pairs solid training with another opportunity to explore some
> limits by finding out if a 30-second effort at 1.5x your FTP comes as a
> detriment to your post-sprint power output. If that's the case, tone down the
> sprints but try to keep the sustained segments just as prescribed.

> Until you firmly grasp the benefit of proper and adequate recovery, only hard
> lessons await you out on the trail. If, however, you've recognized the benefit
> of recovery done correctly, you'll happily abide by the low-intensity, same-

## Week 5

> Following a week-long training decrease that ideally finds you returning with
> some renewed training motivation and fresh legs, it’s time to ramp things back
> up for a couple weeks before tapering your training prior to your most
> important event(s).
> 
> You'll begin with a bit of a mash-up where your hard-start efforts now precede
> several fairly short rounds of on/ _not-quite-off_ repeats. Each one of these
> sets could very closely mimic the demands of the shortest of short track
> races, and having 4 in a row is likely to qualify as race-specific overload
> for most riders.  
> 
> Next, it's a return to the tried and true VO2max durations that range between
> 2-3 minutes at a time starting with some repeated 2.5-minute action. This
> basic structure may not be perfectly in line with the frequent changes in
> effort required on most racecourses, but they're one of the most reliable ways
> to increase FTP as well as build endurance up toward your peak aerobic power.
> 
> Cap off your fifth week with something more in line with the intermittently
> very high power outputs you'll dole out over a technical course by maximizing
> your time spent well above your FTP. By severely stressing your muscles for a
> minute at a time but then rewarding them with a full minute's recovery, you
> can accumulate a significant amount of time at highly practical and productive
> power outputs while avoiding the deep-muscle fatigue that comes with longer,
> more depleting repeats.

## Week 6

> Week 6 begins with a near-repeat of last week's early workout but ups the
> intensity of your initial sprint. For some riders, this will just be the next
> step in the progression toward higher performance. For others, this might
> signify a breaking point. The key is to determine what sort of initial burst
> of power exacts too costly a toll on the remainder of the interval and what
> leaves just enough fuel in the muscles to back up that hard charge.
> 
> This week's second interval session tacks on another 30 seconds to each
> already long VO2max repeat but reduces the overall training load to
> compensate. This is a good time to revisit last week's tips concerning
> productively repeatable power. If you've homed in on the sort of power you can
> barely sustain for 2.5 minutes, 3 minutes might require a slight power
> reduction. Or your fitness and toughness may have risen to a point where you
> can gut out that additional 30 seconds like a boss, no decrease required.  
> 
> Close this demanding week of training with a few merciless rounds of one of
> the sneakiest microburst formats in the TR catalog. In lieu of matching your
> recovery valley durations to each preceding surge's, these efforts are only
> performed at 120% FTP. But don't be too quick to lift the workout's intensity
> until you have a round of these in your legs--these can go from manageable to
> miserable in a hurry.

## Week 7

> Your final  _full-strength_  week of Specialty training begins with one more
> round of hard-start VO2max repeats that includes yet another increase in each

> doesn't as you further your performance self-knowledge.
> 
> Then it's onto another variation in your VO2max repeats that have been trimmed
> down to durations that are likely to only tease your muscles with the torture
> usually promised by longer aerobic-capacity intervals. But what they lack in
> duration they make up for in repetition presenting another opportunity to
> demonstrate restraint in the early stages of a workout (or race).
> 
> This final, pre-taper week then closes out with a fun little assortment of
> anaerobic repeats clustered so tightly that they'll grow increasingly aerobic
> as you progress through each set. At the same time, each grouping of repeats
> aims to simulate the random and unrelenting power requirements of bike racing

## Week 8

> It's time to taper your training load with the goal of leaving you fresh and
> motivated by the weekend. You'll begin with a toned down version of last
> week's familiar format that maintains all of the intensity necessary to keep
> you sharp but dispenses with a bit of the volume that leaves you heavily
> fatigued by the end of the workout.  
> 
> Your VO2max repeats see a volume reduction as well, but they too retain all of
> the intensity necessary to keep you familiar with the pain but light on
> fatigue.
> 
> Saturday is an  _openers_  workout based on a Sunday race, but if your race
> falls on Saturday or perhaps both weekend days, perform the short priming
> workout on Friday instead. If you'd prefer a different openers workout, take a
> look at Scott Peak or the other versions of Truuli.  
> 
> This week’s format can be repeated should you have a string of race weekends
> ahead since it maintains all of the necessary intensity but not nearly as much
> of the fatigue-inducing volume. But don’t plan to utilize this approach for
> more than a few weeks since peak fitness is a short-lived, temporary point in
> your ever-changing fitness.
> 
> But before that decline has any chance set in, go out there and reap the
> rewards of months of hard, consistent training the likes of which only the
> most dedicated and hard-working riders achieve.
