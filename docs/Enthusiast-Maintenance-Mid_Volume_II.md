# Trainer Road Plan: HIT Maintenance - Mid Volume II

> The HIT Maintenance plans are meant to provide competitive riders with a high-
> intensity maintenance training plan that can be used to maintain hard-earned,
> peak or near-peak fitness. At the same time, these plan remain malleable in
> order to allow weekday & weekend race substitutions for the scheduled
> workouts.
> 
> This second version of the HIT Maintenance plan is not an evolution of the
> first version; rather, it's an optional plan that's only different in its
> workout selection. Choose HIT Maintenance I or HIT Maintenance II, any order,
> do one, do both, makes no matter. They're two versions of the same plan aimed
> at providing options for riders with long, competitive seasons who don't want
> to ride the same indoor workouts from Race plan to Race plan.
> 
> And as with version I, riders are given the option to alter the duration of
> each end-of-week long ride, shift it to midweek if necessary, and/or perform
> the ride outdoors when circumstances allow.
> 
> Again, these plans are flexible. But this isn't to say that they require any
> tweaking and riders can choose to follow them just as they are in order to
> maintain high-level fitness should the commonly utilized weekly format suit
> their schedules.

## Week 1

> The first week of any training plan is often dedicated to assessing your
> current fitness, and Week 1 of the HIT Maintenance plans is no exception. If,
> however, you feel that your current FTP estimate is reasonably accurate, you
> can substitute a weeknight club race or pluck a VO2 Max or Anaerobic workout
> from our Workout Library.
> 
> Should you choose to dive into a weeknight world championship, be bold and
> jump off the front for a solo TT that can offer some truer insight into your
> current sustainable power, i.e. FTP.
> 
> Following your assessment or substitution workout, you'll face a set of very
> high-intensity anaerobic power intervals sure to challenge your high-end
> fitness in a series of different durations.
> 
> Your week closes with three rounds of short, 30-second VO2 Max repeats that
> again challenge your race fitness in multiple, simultaneous ways keeping the
> week's aim on target by honing your sharp, race-ready fitness followed by your
> weekly long ride.
> 
> Keep this final workout of the week-long, steady and light, but feel free to
> do it outside if the weather allows it, in a group if you can stay on task,
> and even make it a little longer if your events merit the increased time in
> the saddle.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> Anaerobic and maximum aerobic power are this week's dual aim as you veer from
> one short but brutal format back to the other. You'll kick Week 2 off with
> some very short but very intense efforts set way above your FTP and stacked
> impossibly close together before you tone things down just enough to repeat
> 3-minute-long VO2 Max efforts with equal rest thereby shifting your focus more
> toward high-end, largely oxygen-driven power.
> 
> Finally, you'll close your week with a TR favorite which combines a series of
> muscle-priming sprints before asking you to settle in just above your FTP in
> the spirit of repeating a number of breakaway efforts right before you repeat
> and maybe even grow your weekly long, aerobic ride.
> 
> Feel free to swap out any of this week's workouts for any weekday or weekend
> races you might have on your calendar.

> repeats in the interest of peaking your maximum aerobic power output.

> spin.

## Week 5

> If by now you aren't crazy about the sprint + slightly suprathreshold combo,
> then you might ask yourself if bike racing is really your thing. If, on the
> other hand, this sort of workout is in your wheelhouse, get ready to have
> another go at a very race-applicable workout format.
> 
> Then, it's time for an ideal combination of VO2 Max work and muscle endurance
> enhancing over-unders.
> 
> Finally, you'll round out your week with a workout easily as challenging as
> most of the races you might do in its place. A muscularly punishing
> combination of closely-stacked Threshold efforts target your strength
> endurance while a few closing rounds of even more closely-stacked VO2 Max
> repeats promise to make your already dead-heavy legs feel like useless bags of
> meat dangling from your torso.
> 
> Should the fatigue merit a duration reduction in your long, "easy" day, cut
> some time off your aerobic endurance ride in the interest of fuller recovery
> for next week.

## Week 6

> You say you can't get enough VO2 Max work in your training diet? Well you're
> in luck because Week 6 begins with a seemingly benign series of aerobic
> capacity repeats that grow encouragingly shorter in duration while the watts
> ratchet up, up, up.
> 
> Your second interval endeavor of the week plays off the too-familiar theme of
> intense efforts with barely recognizable recovery opportunities. Anyone can
> suffer from time to time, but workouts like this one will actually teach you
> to embrace the misery.
> 
> The weekend concludes your sixth training week with a race simulation
> incorporating all manner of severe efforts mixed with steadier yet just as
> challenging sustained ones. It's just this type of work that drives home the
> misconception that even when you think you can't work any harder, you actually
> can - and today you will.
> 
> Then with whatever's left in the tank, ride long keep it conversational.

> 
> Should you make it through the early part of this penultimate week craving
> still more abuse, you'll then square off against a few rounds of descending
> anaerobic power intervals that will give you a chance to flex some real muscle
> before allowing you to recharge with more complete recovery than usual for
> this time of year.
> 
> Finally, your week as well as the bulk of this training plan's workload draws
> to a close with another VO2 Max/Threshold workout aimed at topping off your
> aerobic power and then mildly refreshing your muscle endurance right before
