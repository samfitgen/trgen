# Trainer Road Plan: Half Distance Triathlon Build - Low Volume

> Having established your fairly broad base of fitness, these Build blocks shift
> your training emphasis slightly away from intensity and more toward moderate-
> level suffering. The importance of tolerating this longer-term physiological &
> psychological challenge without succumbing to the urge to ease up is now your
> primary focus.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_   **Ramp Test**  With 8 weeks of base work in your legs, it's time
> to reassess your FTP in order to keep your workouts in line with your
> increasing fitness. Stick with the same workout format (Ramp Test, 8 Minute
> FTP Test or 20 Minute FTP Test) that you used the first time and count this as
> the first strength-endurance workout of your Tri Build training block.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max + Speed Intervals (2100m)** Warm-Up 300m
> Easy, RPE4; 8x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x100m Easy-Moderate,
> RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals; 6x75m Hard, RPE9 w/ 45s rest between
> intervals; 6x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between sprints; 8x25m K
> drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 10min working up to Easy-Moderate,
> RPE 6 pace to warm up, then repeat 16 Hard, RPE 9, 30-second high-speed
> surges, recovering for only 30 seconds after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to
> cool down for a total of 36 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Shortoff +1** The greatest benefit of VO2max works comes with
> longer durations at that high aerobic uptake. By adding a minute to each of
> these intervals, you actually gain more than a minute's benefit since this
> extra time is spent at an already highly elevated workload. But keeping things
> elevated means not taking any breaks, and if small reductions in intensity are
> necessary to keep you powering along, shave a few percentage points and keep
> those pedals turning.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Speed Intervals (2000m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m F &T drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 4x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/
> 45s rest between intervals; 4x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 8x25m SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run + Strides** Run an Easy-Moderate 50 minutes at RPE6 pace
> and include 6x20-second relaxed sprints at RPE10 with 40 seconds of rest after
> each one.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Frissell** With a solid base of Sweet Spot endurance in your
> legs, it's time to overshoot your current race pace capabilities in order to
> lift them. Spending time slightly below your FTP is effective to this end and
> it's also more 'forgiving' and requires less recovery between workouts than
> does the harsher work done right at your FTP. This means more high-quality
> work and less time waiting to heal prior to your next workout. Make sure
> you're spending ample time in your aero position while still keeping your
> Target power at the top of your priorities.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2400m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE 4; 1800m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** Run 70min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 with as few, if any,
> walking breaks.

### Monday 

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> _Tuesday_ **Givens** As you adjust to VO2max efforts lasting 3 full minutes
> each, a new objective enters the mix: determining how hard you can work for 3
> minutes at a time and still repeat the effort productively. For some, 110% FTP
> is their max repeatable 3-minute power but for others, efforts all the way up
> at 130% FTP are possible. Find your breaking point, but don't surpass it -
> modify the Workout Intensity accordingly such that you complete each 3-minute
> torture test, barely.

> to cool down for a total of 40 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Deerhorn** In what might be your first exposure to over-under
> intervals, this workout varies the usual format a bit and keeps your efforts
> more random and closer to the sort of demands faced during a steady-state
> effort that involves passing or mildly powering up hills. It's helpful to be
> mentally braced for the temporary discomfort this brings, and it's also useful
> to challenge your current lactate processing capabilities in an effort to
> improve them. Welcome to 40 minutes of 'practice'.

> you'll face an assortment of efforts in the VO2max realm that not only vary
> the intensity but trim your usual 1:1 work-rest ratio down to a point where
> your recoveries are a little less generous and more aerobically demanding. All
> of this adds up to more time spent at a high aerobic uptake, less time spent
> drifting away from that high rate of respiration, and in time, greater
> improvements in sustainable power.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max + Speed Intervals (2250m)** Warm-Up 300m
> Easy, RPE4; 8x25m SA Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x100m Easy-Moderate,

> RPE 6 pace to warm up, then expand this workout a little further with 20 Hard,
> RPE9, 30-second high-speed surges and 30-second recoveries; run 10min Easy,
> RPE 4 to cool down for a total of 40 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Scylla** With a less randomized set of intervals, Scylla will
> ease you into slightly longer, leg-loading efforts above FTP and then give you
> ample time to bear the discomfort as you 'ride it off' just in time for
> another challenging but definitely doable minute above FTP, several times
> over.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Speed Intervals (2200m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;

> rest after each one.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Frissell +1** Building on this same format from a couple weeks
> ago, you'll again repeat efforts slightly below your FTP which is both
> beneficial in terms of increased sustainable power, but also in that your race
> pace isn't likely to be quite so high. So if you can ride this hard, indoors
> probably without the same motivation that racing inspires, very probably with
> less effective cooling, just imagine how manageable slightly lower efforts
> will feel outside on race day.

> and it comes in a relatively friendly format since the concern is more about
> maintaining fitness and absorbing improvements. The intensity is set at 120%
> but you can reduce these as far down as 110% and still maintain the workout's
> objectives pretty well. So if your fatigue is high and you know it, err on the

> 
> _Saturday_ **Glassy** Endurance is still the name of the game, but recovery is
> too. Accordingly, Glassy will trim your effort back far enough that you'll
> still derive ample aerobic benefit without hampering your recovery in the

> Triathlon

## Week 5

> _Tuesday_ **Red Lake +3**  If working slightly below FTP strengthens the base
> for increases in FTP, working slightly above it serves to actualize those
> increases. Use these short but uncomfortable efforts to grow your boundaries,
> both physically and mentally - grow accustomed to the pain rather than trying
> to avoid it. If possible, spend some time in your aero posture, but on-Target
> power is still the top priority.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max Intervals (2100m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;

> surges with a minute's recovery after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down
> for a total of 40 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Bear Creek** Post-recovery-week over-unders - this is gonna hurt
> a bit. With that said, it's the sort of pain you're ready for, both physically
> and mentally. Endure the longer over-segments knowing that a greater training
> stimulus (read: more pain) is often what's necessary to cultivate a stronger,
> more capable athlete. And again, spend as much of the valleys in aero, rise
> when/if necessary, probably during the pushes slightly above FTP.
>

> _Saturday_ **Mount Baldy** Another opportunity to push your sustainable race
> pace a bit higher and send a clear and distinct message to your muscles: MORE
> POWER. Practice working harder than necessary while including recoveries so
> short that they're more about teasing you with relief than actually providing
> it - all part of what's necessary on your path to your best bike split yet.
>
