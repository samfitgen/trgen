# Trainer Road Plan: Short Track Cross-Country - High Volume

> The demands of Short Track Cross-Country racing blend many of the elements of
> mountain bike XC racing with those of road criterium racing. This mix of
> necessary proficiencies demands a rider who can maintain extremely high levels
> of sustained power peppered with even more severe surges, sprints and
> explosive accelerations, all on varied terrain.
> 
> The aim of every version of our STXC plans is to cultivate maximum aerobic
> power and combine it with high-level endurance and a rather extreme ability to
> frequently repeat incredibly high-output efforts.

## Week 1

> In order to get a handle on any recent improvements to your fitness, your
> first workout is the requisite FTP assessment in the form of our Ramp Test to
> allow us to scale your power levels appropriately. If you've used another
> assessment format, continue to use the same one in order to maintain
> consistency but also because it can serve as an effective Threshold/VO2max
> workout.
> 
> Ideally, you'll have a day or two of recovery in your legs and will feel ready
> to fairly demonstrate your current level of fitness. If not, consider riding
> easy today and postponing your assessment until tomorrow.  
> 
> Then it's on to a slightly longer than usual Endurance ride that includes a
> couple late-ride sprints. You'll then head into a cluster of repeats at
> roughly the same suprathreshold power output you exhibited during your FTP
> assessment, but these are shorter and more plentiful. Working above your
> lactic tipping point is an excellent way to stress your maximum aerobic
> capabilities and tax your mind's ability to tolerate a form of discomfort
> that's very much a part of short track XC racing.
> 
> After an end-of-week Endurance spin, the weekend begins with some reasonably
> short but highly race-specific repeats where you'll push to the height of your
> repeatable power capabilities over and over again while only returning to
> Sweet Spot territory to form some semblance of recovery before going again.
> 
> This week closes with a round of hard-start intervals that combine a high-
> power push with some sustained effort done fairly close to your threshold
> power. These are close approximations of the combination of efforts frequently
> encountered over the course of a mass-start race as well as any course with
> punchy climbs or corners.
> 
> You're also welcome to keep things longer and lower-stress via either Flattop
> or Ptarmigan. You're equally encouraged to head outdoors for a ride that racks
> up similar workloads and includes similar efforts to those laid out within
> your training plan.
> 
> Sunday reductions to Sweet Spot are a good way to preserve the intent and
> productivity of the workout but reduce the intensity noticeably.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

### Sunday 

* **Name**: Bondcliff +2

* **NP**: 158
* **IF**: 79%

**Description**:

> Bondcliff +2 is made up of 4x15-minute race-start interval that each begin
> with a 30-second surge at 150% FTP and then quickly settles in at 88% FTP for
> the remaining 14 minutes.
> 
> Each interval is separated by 8 minutes of recovery.

## Week 2

> Your second week of race conditioning begins with a foray into highly-focused
> anaerobic work via repeats far less concerned with any aerobic benefit than
> growing your ability to produce short, very high-energy bursts of power. This
> intent is reflected in the short durations, the super high intensities, and
> the relatively generous recovery intervals.
> 
> Following a midweek Endurance ride (a good time to get outdoors and work on
> your skills if you have the time), your less abusive but no less challenging
> repeats well above FTP grow a bit in duration in order to increase your
> ability to repeat efforts a little tougher than Threshold repeats but not
> quite as tough as ones performed at shorter, more traditional VO2max
> durations. The ability to drive your power this high, hold it, and repeat it
> will have a direct impact on the quality of riders who can hold your wheel for
> any length of time.  
> 
> Following another short aerobic Endurance ride, the weekend kicks off with
> some more atypical VO2max intervals. These are unusual only in the sense that
> you won't encounter them in too many training plans, but you'll surely deal
> with this combination of efforts when racing short track. It's important to be
> able to repeat short, highly powerful surges and then resist the urge to let
> your power fall too far between accelerations. Get on it, stay on it.  
> 
> Finally, it's onto an endurance-oriented evolution of last weekend's Sprint +
> Sweet Spot repeats where the emphasis marginally shifts toward increasing the
> duration that you're able to hold your watts high and steady.  
> 
> Rather ride longer and slower? Consider Big Squaw or Maclure, or head outdoors
> for a similar ride to the one your plan recommends.

## Week 3

> Week 3 begins with another round of Anaerobic repeats that maintain the same
> short-interval, high-intensity, relatively long recovery duration approach
> intent on growing your anaerobic power capabilities.
> 
> Following a midweek recovery ride or skills session, your suprathreshold
> endurance work reaches its peak durations while keeping the total workout
> volume very steady. While it may be a wash in terms of overall stress, you may
> find that these longer durations are surprisingly more difficult. But so will
> every rider trailing in your wake out on the racecourse.  
> 
> Then, this week's VO2max + Sweet Spot repeats incorporate slightly longer
> surges into slightly longer sets and place just a touch more stress on your
> body in the interest of extending your stamina. Should you feel up to the
> challenge, you're welcome to nudge up the intensity a bit if you're feeling
> underchallenged as the sets stack up.  
>   
> Your final, pre-recovery-week workout consists of more hard-start, muscle-
> endurance intervals that increase last weekend's challenge by lifting the
> muscular endurance demands even higher. If you find yourself in a bad spot,
> consider an occasional backpedal (no more than 30 seconds, and no more than 2
> per interval) in order to keep your productivity and your cadence lifted.
> Think "smooth power", even if that means an infrequent and short impromptu
> recovery.  
> 
> Longer/slower alternatives are the same as weeks past: Flattop, Maclure or
> Town Hill. Or feel free to substitute an outdoor equivalent in place of your
> prescribed workout, preferably one that includes some time on the dirt.

## Week 5

> Following a week-long training decrease that ideally finds you returning with
> some renewed training motivation and fresh legs, it’s time to ramp things back
> up for a couple weeks before tapering your training prior to your most
> important event(s).
> 
> You'll begin with a return to some tried and true VO2max durations that range
> between 2-3 minutes at a time starting with some repeated 2-minute action.
> This basic structure may not fall perfectly in line with the frequent changes
> in effort required on most race courses, but they're one of the most reliable
> ways to increase FTP as well as build endurance up toward your peak aerobic
> power.
> 
> Following another midweek ride that can be used to accumulate some aerobic
> saddle time or target skills out on the trail, you'll face a bit of a mash-up
> where your hard-start efforts now precede several fairly short rounds of on/
> _not-quite-off_  repeats. Each one of these sets could very closely mimic the
> demands of the shortest of short track races, and having 6 in a row is likely
> to qualify as race-specific overload for most riders.  
> 
> After another end-of-week Endurance spin, you'll close out this week with some
> extended and varied Sweet Spot work preceded by a short flurry of all-out
> sprint efforts. Use these to simulate the early demands of any mass start race
> where positioning for pivotal course segments can come down to a single
> explosive burst of power.  
> 
> Finally, square off against an hour and a half's worth of Sweet Spot repeats
> that can be swapped out for a similar outdoor alternative or perhaps Mount
> Cook, Tenaya, or Big Mountain if you choose to ride indoors.

## Week 6

> Week 6 begins with a VO2max workout that tacks on another 30 seconds to each
> repeat but reduces the overall training load to compensate. This is a good
> time to revisit last week's tips concerning productively repeatable power. If
> you've honed in on the sort of power you can barely sustain for 2 minutes, 2.5
> minutes might require a slight power reduction. Or your fitness and toughness
> may have risen to a point where you can gut out that additional 30 seconds
> like a boss, no decrease required.
> 
> Noodle through the midweek Endurance ride or head outside and target some
> skill work, then it's onto a noticeably tougher version of last week's hard-
> start VO2max repeats that add another round of work and ups the intensity of
> your initial sprint. For some riders, this will just be the next step in the
> progression toward higher performance. For others, this might signify a
> breaking point. The key is to determine what sort of initial burst of power
> exacts too costly a toll on the remainder of the interval and what leaves just
> enough fuel in the muscles to back up that hard charge.
> 
> After your second short, Endurance ride, your weekend begins with a workout
> very similar to last week's mixed bag of race-like efforts. Do your best to
> muster some solid sprint efforts early on, in excess of the target watts
> **if**  you feel up to the challenge, and then make the various steady-state
> efforts as smooth and seemingly effortless as possible. Look relaxed, be
> relaxed.  
> 
> This pre-taper week then closes with some longer Sweet Spot repeats that can
> be skipped in lieu of some similar-effort outdoor riding or some long, mild
> work done indoors (Big Mountain, Tenaya, and Mount Cook all work) or out.

> hard-start VO2max repeats that includes reductions aplenty. What it doesn't
> include is a noticeable drop in each set's intensity. Feel free to really
> drill each opening sprint, in excess of the power target, if you're confident
> you'll emerge from the weekend feeling a bit fresher than when you began it.
> 
> Following a short, easy, and optional Endurance spin, your first taper weekend
> then begins with a shorter version of your previous Sprints + Sweet Spot
> workouts and then closes out with one last shortened round of Sweet Spot work
> that can be swapped out as usual. Good indoor alternatives are Baxter or

## Week 8

> It's time to taper your training load with the goal of leaving you fresh and
> motivated by the weekend. You'll begin with some VO2max repeats that only see
> a slight volume reduction since a couple minutes is an excellent duration to
> keep you familiar with the pain but light on fatigue.
> 
> Your midweek spin becomes super easy and also optional - skip it if you're not
> feeling fully rested and recovered. Then it's on to some short and sweet hard-
> start intervals that maintain all of the intensity necessary to keep you sharp
> but dispense with a lot of the volume that can leave you heavily fatigued by
> the end of a workout.  
> 
> Noodle for a half hour if it suits you, then Saturday is an  _openers_
> workout based on a Sunday race. But if your race falls on Saturday or perhaps
> both weekend days, perform the short priming workout on Friday in place of
> that easy spin. If you'd prefer a different openers workout, take a look at
> Scott Peak or the other versions of Truuli.  
> 
> Alternatively, you can move Crane +1 to Friday if you'd like to make the week
> a bit lighter but still precede your race(s) with an openers workout.  
> 
> This week’s format can be repeated should you have a string of race weekends
> ahead since it maintains all of the necessary intensity but not nearly as much
> of the fatigue-inducing volume. Don’t plan to utilize this approach for more
> than a few weeks since peak fitness is a short-lived, temporary point in your
> ever-changing fitness.
> 
> Before that decline has any chance set in, go out there and reap the rewards
> of months of hard, consistent training the likes of which only the most
> dedicated and hard-working riders achieve.
