# Trainer Road Plan: Olympic Distance Triathlon - High Volume

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max Intervals (3100m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 10x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 10x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 9x100m Hard, RPE9 w/ 60s rest between intervals;
> 10x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Ramp Test** Time to account for the improvement yielded by the
> last 6 weeks of Build conditioning. You've had at least a couple runs at
> assessment, so try to pace really well and get a good measure of where your
> fitness resides heading into these more specialized workouts.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (3000m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 6x50m F
> &T Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x200m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 10s rest
> between intervals; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals;
> Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Tempo Run** Run 15min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE6 to warm up, then
> run steadily, Moderate-Hard, RPE8 for 25 minutes; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to
> cool down for a total of about 50 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Rubicon +1** As we enter the final weeks of training leading up
> to your most important events and highest levels of fitness, the workouts will
> get increasingly similar to the demands of your events. In the case of the
> bike leg, this means that efforts above FTP get gradually closer to your FTP
> while the intervals grow in number and/or duration.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 10-15min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 to
> warm up, then repeat 5 Hard, RPE 9, 2-minute efforts, recovering for another 2
> minutes after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down for a total of about 45
> minutes of running
> 
> _Friday_ **Pettit** Pettit is still the go-to easy ride at the end of each
> week, but you have a couple options depending on your level of fatigue or your
> desire to increase your weekly TSS a bit. If you're tired, try Taku or a day
> off. If you're looking for just a little time in the saddle, give Whorl or
> Townsend a crack.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Speed Intervals (3200m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 10x25m F drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 8x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 60s
> rest between intervals; 8x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 10x25m K &R drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
> RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Appalachian** Yet another 15-minute addition to what was your
> longest endurance ride. Again, remember that riding indoors can be from
> 1.3-1.7x more productive than riding outside, so keep this in mind if you
> choose to head outdoors today, and maybe focus on keeping the work as steady
> as you can or consider adding on a little time.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Recovery Run + Strides** Run 40 minutes at an Easy, RPE 4 pace
> with the intent to accumulate additional aerobic mileage and maintain a high
> weekly run frequency. Insert 6x20-second relaxed sprints at RPE10 with 40
> seconds of rest between each.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (3200m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE 4; 2600m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run 90min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 and try to keep your
> running as continuous as possible over this relatively long run.

### Monday 

* **Name**: Swim Base + VO2max Intervals 


**Description**:

> Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4 10x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills 10x100m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals 9x100m Hard, RPE9 w/ 60s rest
> between intervals 10x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills Cool-Down 350m
> easy, RPE4


### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!
