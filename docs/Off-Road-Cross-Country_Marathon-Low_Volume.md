# Trainer Road Plan: Cross-Country Marathon - Low Volume

> The Cross-Country Marathon MTB plans will prepare you for the widely varied
> and comparably long-duration nature of XCM racing by combining a focus on
> short, highly repeatable bursts of power coupled with efforts bent on driving
> up the watts and keeping them high for extended lengths of time.
> 
> Performing well over the course of a multi-hour race on unpredictable and
> varied terrain that can veer from wide open fire road to technical, rocky
> singletrack--all on subtle to severe grades--requires a well-rounded rider
> with a wide-ranging set of capabilities. Each version of this plan is intent
> on fulfilling all of these requirements and helping you realize your best
> performance at just the right time.

## Week 1

> Week 1 gets you rolling with an ever-present FTP assessment to account for any
> recent improvements in your sustainable power via our Ramp Test. You're
> welcome to use either the 20 Minute FTP Test or the 8 Minute FTP Test if
> that's your preference. In any case, try to have a day or two of recovery in
> your legs and feel ready to fairly demonstrate your current level of fitness.
> If not, consider riding easy today and postponing your assessment until
> tomorrow.  
> 
> The second workout of the week will force you to operate at a high percentage
> of your VO2max by pushing the watts high and then only letting them drop into
> Sweet Spot territory rather than allowing more sufficient recovery. Efforts
> like these closely simulate those times when aggressive riding--due to
> competitor tactics or the nature of the terrain, or both--is necessary and
> unavoidable.
> 
> Finally, a round of hard-start Threshold efforts will accomplish three goals.
> First, you'll target your ability to generate  _real big_  watts. Second,
> you'll tackle some muscle endurance work up at the high end of your current
> sustainable capabilities. Third, you'll have the opportunity to confirm your
> FTP assessment results many times over.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

* **Name**: Mitchell -1
* **Duration**: 1 hour
* **TSS**: 82.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> Mitchell -1 is made up of 5x5.5-minute sets of VO2max repeats where you'll
> ride for 15-25 seconds at 125% FTP and then float for 15-30 seconds at 88%
> FTP.
> 
> 3 minutes of recovery separate each set.

* **IF**: 90%

**Description**:

> Augusta is made up of 4x15-minute hard-start intervals.
>

> 
> Each interval is separated by 3 minutes of recovery.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 2

> Riding above FTP is tremendously productive, and it's also tremendously
> taxing. But by trimming down the interval durations and inserting short but
> adequate recovery valleys, you can accumulate quite a lot of time at this
> tough but productive output level without exhausting your muscles excessively.
> 
> Up next is a workout very similar to last week's. This affords an opportunity
> to improve on something you may have struggled with, or it allows you to dress
> things up a bit. Maybe you'll spend some of the VO2max surges out of the
> saddle. Maybe you'll vary your cadence during a short burst or two every
> round. Or maybe you'll simply try to make each acceleration as smooth as
> possible thereby conserving as much energy as you can.
> 
> Lastly, last week's already long muscle endurance repeats grow even longer. If
> you find yourself in a bad spot, consider an occasional backpedal (no more
> than 30 seconds, and no more than 2 per interval) in order to keep your
> productivity and your cadence lifted. Think "smooth power", even if that means
> an infrequent and short impromptu recovery.

## Week 3

> Week 3 commences with one extra (but shorter) round of slightly-supra-
> threshold work where you'll continue to challenge your current sustainable
> power limits as you manage the accumulating fatigue without easing up.
> 
> Then your race-simulating VO2max + Sweet Spot intervals grow ever so slightly
> in duration but retain every bit of their relentless  _on/barely off/on_
> pattern of muscle and lung abuse.  
> 
> This pre-recovery-week round of workouts then bestows upon thee an opportunity
> to make good use of that ever-reliable backpedal tactic, should you need it.
> By drawing each post-sprint Threshold effort out to a full half hour, you're
> sure to occasionally question your ability to endure the discomfort as you
> reinforce your rising ability to withstand high, but not too-high, watts.

Rest Day

## Week 4

> Time to let the last few weeks of training soak in over the course of an easy
> week of riding. During this week, try not to lose sight of the fact that
> **adaptation happens during recovery** , not during the often muscle-damaging
> doses of high-intensity training that comprised much of the last few weeks.
> 
> Until you firmly grasp the benefit of proper and adequate recovery, only hard
> lessons await you out on the trail. If, however, you've recognized the benefit
> of recovery done correctly, you'll happily abide the low-intensity, same-
> training-schedule nature of this easy week.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 5

> With rested legs and a reinvigorated mind, it’s time for some new workout
> formats to further broaden your base of capabilities and to start to put a
> point on your high-level forms of fitness. Up first, a round of short but
> closely set anaerobic repeats that grow increasingly aerobic as each set
> progresses thereby affording you the best of a couple worlds.
> 
> Up next, you'll couple your hard-start prowess with your ability to
> accelerate, relent only slightly, then ramp up the power until the end of the
> interval. Repeats like these are akin to the combination of efforts required
> to accelerate hard but briefly and then stay on the gas until the top of a
> hill or well past a competitor.
> 
> Then, week 5 closes with some extended Sweet Spot intervals aimed at
> furthering your ability to sustain a high but manageable level of effort for
> increasingly longer periods of time.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 6

> First up this week, your  _anaerobic-aerobic_  repeats hold duration but
> become even more tightly packed together. Stands to reason that if you
> struggled with this wattage and longer recovery valleys, a slight drop in
> target power is in order for these compressed sets of repeats. Remember, it's
> not about survival, it's about productivity. Performing 7 high-power minutes
> steadily and with proper pedaling mechanics is far superior training than 7
> minutes of fighting the bike and repeatedly falling apart during the final 30
> seconds.  
>   
> Then, this week's iteration of hard starts + Threshold ramps simply ups the
> demand of the initial sprint while leaving the rest of each interval the same.
> This is likely to inspire slightly greater fatigue during the initial minutes
> of each ramp, but half the challenge of this interval format is pushing
> through the pain and keeping the power rising all the way to and through that
> final second. Push _past_ that rider in front of you, push _past_ the top of
> that hill.  
>   
> Your week then closes with some longer but ever so slightly kinder Sweet Spot
> repeats where your objective is to make the mildly varied efforts as smooth
> and seemingly effortless as possible. Look relaxed, be relaxed.

## Week 7

> Your final  _full-strength_  week of Specialty training begins with a workout
> very similar to last week's, but this time the durations shrink a bit in order
> to allow a touch of race freshness to rise toward the surface. The still-short
> recovery valleys will again elevate the aerobic demand earlier in each set as
> they increasingly tax your aerobic capabilities when your anaerobic power
> loses steam.
> 
> Then it's onto a final round of a now familiar combination workout. And this
> week the severity of the sprints rises yet again in the interest of peaking
> your sprint power delivery right along with the rest of your off-road
> endurance fitness.
> 
> This final, pre-taper week then closes out with one last round of Sweet Spot
> intervals, each of which is downright long. But then, it's likely you'll face
> repeats as long as these over the course of your next XCM race.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 8

> With your peak fitness and events on the immediate horizon, it’s time to pull
> you up from the depths of your fatigue and sharpen your fitness. To this end,
> you’ll face reduced-load workouts very similar in format to recent
> corresponding workouts. The difference will be evident in the reduced volume,
> but that’s where the reductions end as all of the intensity is necessarily
> maintained.
> 
> Saturday is an  _openers_  workout based on a Sunday race, but if your race
> falls on Saturday or perhaps both weekend days, perform the short priming
> workout on Friday instead. If you'd prefer a different openers workout, take a
> look at Scott Peak or the other versions of Truuli.
> 
> Alternatively, you can move Crane +1 to Friday if you'd like to make the week
> a bit lighter but still precede your race(s) with an openers workout.
> 
> And if for some reason you aren't racing this weekend, it's a good idea to
> slot in a repeat of one of your Sunday Sweet Spot workouts in place of an
> outdoor race or get out on the trail for something equally intense and of
> similar duration as your upcoming event(s).
> 
> Otherwise, go toe the start line with a rested and primed body along with a
> confident and refreshed state of mind. You’ve done the work, now go out there
> and grab the glory.
