# Trainer Road Plan: Short Track Cross-Country - Mid Volume

> The demands of Short Track Cross-Country racing blend many of the elements of
> mountain bike XC racing with those of road criterium racing. This mix of
> necessary proficiencies demands a rider who can maintain extremely high levels
> of sustained power peppered with even more severe surges, sprints and
> explosive accelerations, all on varied terrain.
> 
> The aim of every version of our STXC plans is to cultivate maximum aerobic
> power and combine it with high-level endurance and a rather extreme ability to
> frequently repeat incredibly high-output efforts.

## Week 1

> In order to get a handle on any recent improvements to your fitness, your
> first workout is the requisite FTP assessment in the form of our Ramp Test to
> allow us to scale your power levels appropriately. If you've used another
> assessment format, continue to use the same one in order to maintain
> consistency but also because it can serve as an effective Threshold/VO2max
> workout.  
> 
> Ideally, you'll have a day or two of recovery in your legs and will feel ready
> to fairly demonstrate your current level of fitness. If not, consider riding
> easy today and postponing your assessment until tomorrow.  
> 
> Then it's on to a slightly longer than usual Endurance ride that includes a
> couple late-ride sprints. You'll then head into a cluster of repeats at
> roughly the same suprathreshold power output you exhibited during your FTP
> assessment, but these are shorter and more plentiful. Working above your
> lactic tipping point is an excellent way to stress your maximum aerobic
> capabilities and tax your mind's ability to tolerate a form of discomfort
> that's very much a part of short track XC racing.
> 
> The weekend begins with some reasonably short but highly race-specific repeats
> where you'll push to the height of your repeatable power capabilities over and
> over again while only returning to Sweet Spot territory to form some semblance
> of recovery before going again.
> 
> This week closes with a round of hard-start intervals that combine a high-
> power push with some sustained effort done fairly close to your threshold
> power. These are close approximations of the combination of efforts frequently
> encountered over the course of a mass-start race as well as any course with
> punchy climbs or corners.
> 
> You're also welcome to keep things longer and lower-stress via either Springer
> Mountain or Koip. And you're equally encouraged to head outdoors for a ride
> that racks up similar workloads and includes similar efforts to those laid out
> within your training plan.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!


### Wednesday 

* **Name**: Collins +1
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 15 minutes
* **TSS**: 64.0

### Saturday 

* **Name**: Wolfjaw +1
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 15 minutes
* **TSS**: 97.0
* **NP**: 176
* **IF**: 88%

**Description**:

> Wolfjaw +1 is 6 sets lasting about 4.5 minutes each and consisting of
> 7x20-second VO2 Max repeats where you'll ride for 20 seconds at 130% FTP and
> then "float" at 88% FTP for 15-30 seconds in between.
> 
> 5 minutes of recovery separate each set.


### Sunday 

* **Name**: The Chimneys +2
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 106.0
* **NP**: 168
* **IF**: 84%

**Description**:

> The Chimneys +2 is 5x9-minute Big Gear Starts consisting of a 30-second wind-
> up at 130% FTP in the biggest gear you can turn.
> 
> These hard starts are followed closely by 8 minutes of Threshold work at 95%
> FTP in a gear that allows you to spin at a more reasonable cadence.
> 
> Each recovery between intervals is 5 minutes long.

## Week 2

> Your second week of race conditioning begins with a foray into highly-focused
> anaerobic work via repeats far less concerned with any aerobic benefit than
> growing your ability to produce short, very high-energy bursts of power. This
> intent is reflected in the short durations, the super high intensities, and
> the relatively generous recovery intervals.
> 
> Following a midweek Endurance ride (a good time to get outdoors and work on
> your skills if you have the time), your less abusive but no less challenging
> repeats well above FTP grow a bit in duration in order to increase your
> ability to repeat efforts a little tougher than Threshold repeats but not
> quite as tough as ones performed at shorter, more traditional VO2max
> durations. The ability to drive your power this high, hold it, and repeat it
> will have a direct impact on the quality of riders who can hold your wheel for
> any length of time.
> 
> The weekend kicks off with some more atypical VO2max intervals. These are
> unusual only in the sense that you won't encounter them in too many training
> plans, but you'll surely deal with this combination of efforts when racing
> short track. It's important to be able to repeat short, highly powerful surges
> and then resist the urge to let your power fall too far between accelerations.
> Get on it, stay on it.  
> 
> Finally, it's onto a near repeat of last weekend's Sprint + Threshold repeats
> where the emphasis marginally shifts to improving your sprint power but
> doesn't lose sight of the necessity to hold your post-sprint watts high.  
> 
> Rather ride longer and slower? Consider Springer Mountain or Koip, or head
> outdoors for a similar ride to the one your plan recommends.

> Each recovery between intervals is 5 minutes long.

## Week 3

> Week 3 begins with another round of Anaerobic repeats that maintain the same
> short-interval, high-intensity, relatively long recovery duration approach
> intent on growing your anaerobic power capabilities.
> 
> Following a midweek recovery ride or skills session, your suprathreshold
> endurance work reaches its peak durations while keeping the total workout
> volume very steady. While it may be a wash in terms of overall stress, you may
> find that these longer durations are surprisingly more difficult. But so will
> every rider trailing in your wake out on the racecourse.  
> 
> Then, this week's VO2max + Sweet Spot repeats incorporate slightly longer
> surges into slightly longer sets and place just a touch more stress on your
> body in the interest of extending your stamina. Should you feel up to the
> challenge, you're welcome to nudge up the intensity a bit if you're feeling
> underchallenged as the sets stack up.
> 
> Your final, pre-recovery-week set of hard-start, muscle-endurance intervals
> repeats last weekend's change and lifts the opening sprint's demands even
> higher. This pairs solid training with another opportunity to explore some
> limits by finding out if a 30-second effort at 1.5x your FTP comes as a
> detriment to your post-sprint power output. If that's the case, tone down the
> sprints but try to keep the sustained segments just as prescribed.  
> 
> Longer/slower and outdoor alternatives are the same as weeks past: Springer
> Mountain, Koip, or an outdoor equivalent preferably including some time on the
> dirt.

## Week 4

> Time to let the last few weeks of training soak in over the course of an easy
> week of riding. During this week, try not to lose sight of the fact that

> lessons await you out on the trail. If, however, you've recognized the benefit
> of recovery done correctly, you'll happily abide by the low-intensity, same-

## Week 5

> Following a week-long training decrease that ideally finds you returning with
> some renewed training motivation and fresh legs, it’s time to ramp things back
> up for a couple weeks before tapering your training prior to your most
> important event(s).
> 
> You'll begin with something very much in line with the intermittently very
> high power outputs you'll dole out over a technical course by maximizing your
> time spent well above your FTP. By severely stressing your muscles for a
> minute at a time but then rewarding them with a full minute's recovery, you
> can accumulate a significant amount of time at highly practical and productive
> power outputs while avoiding the deep-muscle fatigue that comes with longer,
> more depleting repeats.  
> 
> Following another midweek ride that can be used to accumulate some aerobic
> saddle time or target skills out on the trail, it's a return to the tried and
> true VO2max durations that range between 2-3 minutes at a time starting with
> some repeated 2-minute action. This basic structure may not be perfectly in
> line with the frequent changes in effort required on most racecourses, but
> they're one of the most reliable ways to increase FTP as well as build
> endurance up toward your peak aerobic power.
> 
> Your fifth weekend begins with a bit of a mash-up where your hard-start
> efforts now precede several fairly short rounds of on/ _not-quite-off_
> repeats. Each one of these sets could very closely mimic the demands of the
> shortest of short track races, and having 6 in a row is likely to qualify as
> race-specific overload for most riders.  
> 
> Finally, you'll close out this week with some extended and varied Sweet Spot
> work preceded by a short flurry of all-out sprint efforts. Use these to
> simulate the early demands of any mass start race where positioning for
> pivotal course segments can come down to a single explosive burst of power.
> 
> And by now, you've likely got a handle on your weekend alternatives, but if
> you're looking for a few suggestions then check out Laurentian, Conness, or
> the ever reliable Springer Mountain.

## Week 6

> Week 6 begins with a fun little assortment of anaerobic repeats clustered so
> tightly that they'll grow increasingly aerobic as you progress through each
> set. At the same time, each grouping of repeats aims to simulate the random
> and unrelenting power requirements of bike racing on ever-changing terrains.
> 
> Noodle through the midweek Endurance ride or head outside and target some
> skill work, then your second interval session of the week tacks on another 30
> seconds to each VO2max repeat but reduces the overall training load to
> compensate. This is a good time to revisit last week's tips concerning
> productively repeatable power. If you've homed in on the sort of power you can
> barely sustain for 2 minutes, 2.5 minutes might require a slight power
> reduction. Or your fitness and toughness may have risen to a point where you
> can gut out that additional 30 seconds like a boss, no decrease required.
> 
> Then it's onto a noticeably tougher version of last week's hard-start VO2max
> repeats that adds another round of work and ups the intensity of your initial
> sprint. For some riders, this will just be the next step in the progression
> toward higher performance. For others, this might signify a breaking point.
> The key is to determine what sort of initial burst of power exacts too costly
> a toll on the remainder of the interval and what leaves just enough fuel in
> the muscles to back up that hard charge.  
> 
> Your weekend wraps up with a workout very similar to last week's mixed bag of
> race-like efforts. Do your best to muster some solid sprint efforts early on,
> in excess of the target watts  **if**  you feel up to the challenge, and then
> make the various steady-state efforts as smooth and seemingly effortless as
> possible. Look relaxed, be relaxed.  
>

## Week 7

> Your first of two taper week's begins with a couple merciless rounds of one of
> the sneakiest microburst formats in the TR catalog. In lieu of matching your
> recovery valley durations to each preceding surge's, these efforts are only
> performed at 130% FTP. Don't be too quick to lift the workout's intensity
> until you have a round of these in your legs--these can go from manageable to
> miserable in a hurry.
> 
> After another midweek Endurance/Skills session, it's onto a seemingly friendly
> VO2max workout that aims to keep all the necessary intensity intact while
> reducing the overall workout stress load to a point where you remain sharp and
> not overly fatigued by the following day.
> 
> This reduced-load weekend begins with one more round of hard-start VO2max
> repeats that includes reductions aplenty. What it doesn't include is a
> noticeable drop in each set's intensity. Feel free to really drill each
> opening sprint, in excess of the power target, if you're confident you'll
> emerge from the weekend feeling a bit fresher than when you began it.
> 
> The week winds down following another round of a now familiar combination
> workout. This week drops the workout's volume but leaves the intensity
> untouched. Ideally, this is enough of a reduction in workload to allow your
> muscles to begin their rebound in anticipation of your peak event(s).

## Week 8

> It's time to taper your training load with the goal of leaving you fresh and
> motivated by the weekend. You'll begin with some short & sweet hard-start
> intervals that maintain all of the intensity necessary to keep you sharp but
> dispense with a lot of the volume that can leave you heavily fatigued by the
> end of a workout.  
> 
> Your midweek spin becomes super easy and also optional - skip it if you're not
> feeling fully rested and recovered. Your VO2max repeats only see a slight
> volume reduction since a couple minutes is an excellent duration to keep you
> familiar with the pain but light on fatigue.
> 
> Saturday is an  _openers_  workout based on a Sunday race, but if your race
> falls on Saturday or perhaps both weekend days, perform the short priming
> workout on Friday instead. If you'd prefer a different openers workout, take a
> look at Scott Peak or the other versions of Truuli.  
> 
> This week’s format can be repeated should you have a string of race weekends
> ahead since it maintains all of the necessary intensity but not nearly as much
> of the fatigue-inducing volume. Don’t plan to utilize this approach for more
> than a few weeks since peak fitness is a short-lived, temporary point in your
> ever-changing fitness.
> 
> Before that decline has any chance set in, go out there and reap the rewards
> of months of hard, consistent training the likes of which only the most
> dedicated and hard-working riders achieve.
