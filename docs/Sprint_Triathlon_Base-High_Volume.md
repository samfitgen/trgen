# Trainer Road Plan: Sprint Triathlon Base - High Volume

> The high-volume version of the Sprint Triathlon Base plan has triathletes
> swimming 4 times each week for up to 10,500m, on the bike four times each week
> for up to 5 hour in total (including a couple brick workouts), and running up
> to 3.5 hours weekly.
> 
> This 4-week plan is aimed at experienced, multisport athletes looking to reach
> their full-potential and quite possibly the podium. While this is possible
> with less training time, these plans attempt to extract the peak level of
> performance improvement through a high amount of weekly time. At a maximum 12
> hours per week, training time is relatively high when compared to the duration
> of these short, fast, and intense events but should still be manageable. The
> primary aim remains focused on establishing base fitness in all 3 disciplines.
> 
> Note: Double-day workouts can be done in any order and separated by as little
> or as much time as you choose, as long as you can keep the quality of both
> workouts high.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base + Sprint Intervals (2300m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 6x50m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 8x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 10x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 10x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
> RPE4.
> 
> _Tuesday_   **FTP Assessment**  Get a solid estimate of your current fitness
> via the Ramp Test, or if you prefer, the 20 Minute FTP Test or the 8 Minute
> FTP Test. Whichever format you choose, try to use that format for every FTP
> assessment workout you perform.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2400m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 6x50m S
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x200m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 10s rest
> between intervals; 4x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals;
> Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Run 40min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> randomly insert 6x30s bursts of high speed, RPE9 over the course of the run
> with at least a minute’s recovery between each controlled, high-speed burst.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Ericsson** Time to target leg speed with the aim of improving
> your pedal efficiency (or your ability to turn the pedals with the minimal
> amount of effort and energy). You’ll work in a narrow, but highly productive
> power range. This will be close enough to your FTP to get your mind and body
> ready for the more rigorous workouts to follow in later training phases, but
> not a range that’s too taxing to prevent fairly rapid recovery.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run** Run 45min Easy-Moderate, RPE6. That’s it; keep it
> simple, try to keep it continuous, use 1-minute walk-breaks if necessary.
> 
> _Friday_ **Carson** More steady-effort repeats in the Sweet Spot power range;
> these are aimed at growing your ability to not only push the pedals with
> reasonable force, but to grow your endurance such that you can keep doing so
> over the course of each interval, workout and bike leg.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals + Sprints (2300m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 6x50m FS Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x150m of 50m Easy, RPE4/25m Hard,
> RPE8, 15s rest between intervals; 6x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest
> between sprints; 10x25m SK Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m
> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Antelope** 50 total minutes of endurance work as you face fairly
> long intervals, and quite a few of them. Fortunately, the recovery between
> each interval is pretty generous in the interest of keeping the steady,
> endurance-building watts comin’ for each of the 5 intervals.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Base Run** 45min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. If necessary, you
> can walk briefly, for no more than a minute at a time, if it means the
> difference between running well and sacrificing form while running efficiency
> suffers. Quick walking breaks of a single minute can often keep your form high
> while costing very little in terms of aerobic fitness improvements.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (1900m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 1200m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 50min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6, intermittent 1-minute
> walks if you need them.

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> working on strength. By drilling it for a short period of 20 seconds at a
> time, your muscles will receive a loud-and-clear request for for more - more
> muscle, more work, more power. This is some true, on-the-bike strength work
> that will lift your ability to power the pedals for short durations and also
> much, much longer ones.
>

> 
> _Thursday_ **Tunnabora** While keeping your watts in that same narrow and
> reasonably high range, you 'll again target your ability to sustain a high
> percentage of your FTP while also addressing how fluidly and quickly you turn
> the pedals. Mesh a little leg speed and fluid pedaling technique with your
> ability to ride only a little below your FTP.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run** Run 45min Easy-Moderate, RPE6. Still keeping it
> simple, still trying to keep it continuous, still using 1-minute walk-breaks
> if necessary.
> 
> _Friday_ **Brick Workout (Monitor + 10min Transition Run)** A pretty
> straightforward bike workout that repeats 6-minute Sweet Spot efforts while
> trimming the recoveries to a scant 2 minutes. If you find yourself under-
> challenged by these intervals and you 're recovering well between bike
> workouts, consider adding 2-3% to your FTP during the latter 3 or 4 intervals
> in order to determine if your FTP could use a little adjustment. Then, as
> quickly as possible, transition from the bike into your running gear and run
> at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 for only 10 minutes in order to get a feel for
> running directly off the bike, with a little bit of fatigue in your legs.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals + Sprints (2200m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;

> 
> _Saturday_ **Galena** Taking the traditional 2x20 Sweet Spot workout a step
> further, this longer bike workout will challenge your endurance capabilities
> over the course of 3 long efforts all aimed at improving your mental and
> physical stamina. Do your best to keep the pedals turning forward for each
> long set; you can use 10-second backpedals - much in the same way that you
> occasionally use 1-minute walk breaks - if your form or cadence start to tank.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Base Run** 50min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. If you 're relying
> on occasional minute-long walking breaks, make sure that you're extending the
> running segments each week. For example, if you ran for 8 minutes before
> taking a walk-break last week, try to run for 9 or 10 minutes before walking
> this week.
