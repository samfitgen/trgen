# Trainer Road Plan: Olympic Triathlon Build - Low Volume

> These Build blocks place increasing importance on not only extending but
> sustaining your soon-to-be-elevated power & pace. Enduring some rather high-
> level discomfort is challenging but necessary in order to push you to this new
> level of performance.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max Intervals (1750m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4;
> 6x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 6x75m Hard, RPE9 w/ 45s rest between intervals; 6x25m
> K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_   **Ramp Test**  With 6 weeks of base work in your legs, it's time
> to reassess your FTP in order to keep your workouts in line with your
> increasing fitness. Stick with the same workout format (Ramp Test, 8 Minute
> FTP Test or 20 Minute FTP Test) that you used the first time and count this as
> the first strength-endurance workout of your Tri Build training block.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 10-15min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 to
> warm up, then repeat 14 Hard, RPE 9, 30-second efforts, recovering for only 30
> seconds after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down for a total of about 40
> minutes of running
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold Intervals (1600m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 6x25m F
> &Tdrills w/ 10s rest between drills; 4x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 45s rest
> between intervals; 6x25m SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 250m
> easy, RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Mills** Upping the volume of your hardest VO2max workout to date
> by a full set of 3 intervals may sound a bit hefty, but these 'peak and fade'
> repeats are a little more forgiving than the steadier format, and there's even
> a little bit of rest between each set. So if you made intensity reductions to
> in the past, see how a few of these intervals go before making reductions here
> - you may be pleasantly surprised.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** Run 60min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 but try to keep your
> running as continuous as possible.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Base + VO2max Intervals


**Description**:

> 250m Easy Warm-Up (RPE4) 6x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest 5x100m Easy-Moderate
> (RPE6) w/ 5s rest 6x75m Hard (RPE9) w/ 45s rest 6x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest

### Wednesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> _Wednesday_ **Dade -1** Building on last week's 'diminishing' format, this
> round of VO2max repeats will hold you steadily at your highest aerobic output
> for the entire 2 minutes. Knock the intensity down a bit if you must, but by

> K drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Shortoff +1** The greatest benefit of VO2max works comes with
> longer durations at that high aerobic uptake. By adding a minute to each of
> these intervals, you actually gain more than a minute's benefit since this

> 
> _Saturday_ **Frissell** With a solid base of Sweet Spot endurance in your
> legs, it's time to start gravitating more toward intended race pace. Spending
> time slightly below your FTP is both beneficial in this respect but it's also
> likely that you'll spend most your bike leg working at an effort level very
> close to the high percentage of FTP you'll sustain during each of these
> 9-minute repeats. Make sure you're spending ample time in your aero position
> while still keeping your Target power at the top of your priorities.

> _Wednesday_ **Givens** As you adjust to VO2max efforts lasting 3 full minutes
> each, a new objective enters the mix: determining how hard you can work for 3
> minutes at a time and still repeat the effort productively. For some, 110% FTP
> is their max repeatable 3-minute power but for others, efforts all the way up

> _Saturday_ **Frissell +1** Building on this same format from a couple weeks
> ago, you'll again repeat efforts slightly below your FTP which is both
> beneficial in terms of increased sustainable power, but also in that you'll
