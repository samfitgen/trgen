# Trainer Road Plan: Rolling Road Race - Mid Volume

## Week 1

> You first workout is likely to be your final FTP reassessment, at least for
> this training cycle. We'll need to account for improvement acquired during
> your Build training, but the steady weekly training load ahead won't merit
> further FTP monitoring since the focus is now more on refining your fitness
> and less on raising more basic work capacities. You’re free to use any
> assessment workout you prefer, but it’s recommended that you use the same one
> you’ve used up to this point.
> 
> Following a longer-than-typical aerobic Endurance workout (the extra saddle
> time makes up for the lower TSS of your FTP assessment yesterday), you'll
> endure several rounds of 40/20's that will simultaneously target your
> anaerobic capabilities while gradually increasing the stress on your aerobic
> system as each round progresses, all in an on-off format common to mass start
> racing.
> 
> Then, your first weekend begins with the first of many combination workouts
> aimed at melding your varied performance capabilities into a single workout
> thereby simulating many of the demands you'll face during competition. In this
> case, 5 pairs of VO2max repeats with somewhat more challenging recovery
> valleys in between them mimic the demands you might face when racing a shorter
> circuit.
> 
> Close your week out by fortifying the base over which your varied abilities
> are built with some straightforward muscle-endurance work in the form of some
> moderately long Sweet Spot repeats. If you'd rather go longer and slower, Koip
> works well and so does Springer Mountain which includes a few very short
> sprint efforts.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!


### Wednesday 

* **Name**: Townsend
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 60.0
* **NP**: 126
* **IF**: 63%

**Description**:

> Townsend consists simply of 90 minutes of aerobic Endurance spent between
> 60-70% FTP.


### Thursday 

* **Name**: Merced +1
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 15 minutes
* **TSS**: 104.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> Merced +1 is 6 sets of 5x40-seconds efforts at 135% FTP with very short,
> 20-second recoveries between them. The active recoveries between each set of
> 40/20's are a little over 5 minutes long.

### Saturday 

* **Name**: Diamond Valley Road Race +1
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 116.0
* **NP**: 176
* **IF**: 88%

**Description**:

> This 6-lap workout is a race simulation based on the make-or-break segment of
> a Carson/Tahoe/Reno road race course.
> 
> It begins with an initial effort lasting 2 minutes at 115% FTP, a brief
> 30-second active recovery, 2 minutes of Tempo work, and then a second 2-minute
> effort at 115% FTP that concludes with a 30-second kick at 120% FTP.
> 
> Recovery between each interval is 5 minutes long.


### Sunday 

* **Name**: Antelope +2
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 103.0
* **NP**: 166
* **IF**: 83%

**Description**:

> Antelope +2 is 5x10-minute Sweet Spot intervals at 94% FTP with 5-minute
> recoveries between intervals.
> 
> Riders have the option to spend incrementally longer periods of time in an
> aerodynamic position.

## Week 2

> Week 2 begins with the first in a series of Anaerobic interval workouts aimed
> at growing your peak power outputs over several short but varied durations.
> Being able to dole out big watts isn't truly useful unless you can do it
> repeatedly without falling apart.
> 
> Following a shorter midweek spin, a trio of densely packed efforts near and
> well above your FTP will put pressure on your anaerobic resources forcing your
> well-developed aerobic system to take up the slack. This multi-faceted assault
> maintains the theme of stressing multiple energy systems in manners similar to
> those encountered within a field of aggressive riders.
> 
> Your weekend starts with another combination workout that's a little more
> evenly divided between sustained power and high-end aerobic & anaerobic
> repeats. The idea here is to emulate the demands faced near the end of a race
> when the general fatigue is high and the race outcome hinges on your ability
> to repeatedly surge and recover.
> 
> This second week closes with some more slightly-subthreshold work that aims to
> maintain and even slightly lift your strength-endurance capabilities in a more
> engaging manner than typically straight blocks of Sweet Spot work. Swap this
> one again for Koip or Springer Mountain if you'd prefer lower intensity but a
> bit more time in the saddle, possibly a few sprints.

### Sunday 

* **Name**: Carillon +1
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 102.0
* **NP**: 164
* **IF**: 82%

**Description**:

> Carillon +1 consists of 3 sets of 2x10-minute Criss-Cross intervals ranging

> 30-second surges as each interval weaves back & forth across the Sweet Spot
> power range.
> 
> 1 minute of recovery separates the intervals & 5 minutes of recovery separate
> the 2 sets.

## Week 3

> Week 3 compares closely to last week, both in format and total training
> stress, starting with another round of Anaerobic repeats that step down in
> intensity, up in duration, then reverse the pattern. But this time, the
> durations are twice as long and the watts are nearly as sky-high as last
> week's anaerobic power workout.
> 
> After your short, midweek Endurance ride, this week's high-volume/low rest
> Anaerobic repeats shift from 40/20's to 30/30's as the intensity backs off
> only slightly. Again, big power  _don't mean a thang_  if you can't repeat it,
> a lot.
> 
> Your weekend race simulation is easily one of the cruelest formats in the
> entire TR catalog, but it's also on the short list of workouts that tell you
> that you're not just ready to race, you're ready to  **crush**  it. The early
> paceline repeats are far and away the bulk of the workout, so reserve your
> focus for them and then just hang in there as best you can during the
> comparatively invisible VO2max repeats.
> 
> Finally, another round to base-fitness reinforcement awaits, this time your
> Sweet Spot repeats are 12 minutes long with even shorter recovery valleys to
> push your muscle endurance in a couple manners - more work, less rest. Same
> lower-intensity options are on offer (Koip or Springer Mountain), and of
> course, you're welcome to ride outdoors and accumulate a similar amount of
> training stress on the open road.

## Week 4

> Recovery weeks are an opportunity to dial back the intensity, maintain your
> ride schedule, and heal from the previous weeks of training. Accordingly, the
> intensity is low for each of your rides this week with the exception of a
> small handful of very short sprint efforts that will keep your muscles firing
> on all cylinders without accumulating high amounts of counterproductive,
> performance-degrading stress.
> 
> If you feel as though you're truly rested and ready to resume your upward-
> performance trajectory by the weekend, feel free to do a bit of work over the
> weekend as long as it doesn't send you into week 5 carrying too much fatigue
> for your final round of high-intensity workouts.

## Week 5

> As you work your way toward your taper and race weeks, the workouts grow
> increasingly specific to the often brutal demands of mass-start racing on
> punchy, rolling courses.
> 
> You're welcome to use today to reassess changes in your FTP, but due to the
> shift from a focus on building fitness to one on honing fitness, you may not
> see substantial changes in your FTP during this specialized phase of training.
> Alternatively, you can simply add 1-3% to your FTP if you suspect a slight
> bump in your Functional Threshold Power.
> 
> If you choose to skip the FTP reassessment, your first workout is the last one
> aimed solely at improving your anaerobic capacity while subsequent workouts
> will make use of the gains that follow this last assortment of short-duration,
> very high-power intervals. Do your best to complete each interval, even if
> that means minor reductions in the Target power.
> 
> Spin off some of the heaviness induced by Tuesday's anaerobic onslaught and
> then move onto a workout that splits its aim between challenging your ability
> to sustain power slightly above your FTP as well as your ability to wind up
> huge watts for a short but relentless series of sprints all packed into some
> brutally challenging 4-minute efforts. Think of the closing minutes of any
> hotly contested race where you find yourself still in the hunt and you'll
> understand what we're trying to replicate here.
> 
> Then this week definitely saved the best for last, starting with Broken Finger
> which mashes together a pair of Coach Chad favorites that will demonstrate
> your ability to recover quickly, repeat high watts over and over, and then
> combine raw power with deep, foundational muscle endurance, all inside of 90
> minutes.
> 
> And then wrap up this week with some rather long but manageably intense Sweet
> Spot repeats and keep reinforcing that all-important base of high-end
> endurance. Koip and Springer Mountain are still your go-to alternatives for
> lower-intensity riding, but logging some outdoor mileage is inarguably more
> even with the demands of your rolling road races.

> minutes of recovery between intervals.

## Week 6

> Your final, full-volume week begins with your first of 3 weeks' worth of
> attack-and-recover brutality in the form of a workout named  _Huxley_. Each
> set within is  a mash-up of all things painful but also a great demonstration
> that you can, in fact, face almost anything. Make sure to get out of the
> saddle during the attacks as you take advantage of the high-end power you've
> built over the course of your Anaerobic interval workouts.
> 
> After a necessarily short and easy aerobic spin, you'll experience what might
> be your first dance with Mr. Joe Devel but almost certainly won't be your
> last. This quartet of short/short intervals will see you repeating efforts
> anywhere from 120-150% of your FTP with never more than 15 blink-and-you'll-
> miss-them seconds of recovery between repeats. Chances are very strong that at
> least one of these sets will push your capabilities to their fullest extents
> buying you one final increase in your aerobic power capabilities.
> 
> To kick off your weekend, you'll square off against another combination
> workout that first takes some of the wind out of your sails via some muscle-
> sapping anaerobic repeats á la Black Kaweah before capping things off with a
> couple of mercilessly long trips up to your VO2max. Survive this one and
> there's really nothing you'll face on race day that can possibly unhitch you.
> 
> Week 6 closes with a close cousin of last weekend's Sweet Spot intervals and
> can be swapped out for the usual Koip, Springer Mountain or equal-TSS, outdoor
> ride.

## Week 7

> Time to dial things back and let any further fitness buried underneath your
> fatigue begin to rise to the surface. We’ll keep the intensity, cut the volume
> way back, and start to gradually taper things down to a bare minimum that
> finds you as fresh as possible in about 2 weeks' time.
> 
> Both weekday interval workouts are trimmed down versions of what you saw last
> week aiming to keep your muscles and mind attuned to the intensity while
> reducing the overall training load in order to recover some freshness without
> sacrificing any fitness in the process.
> 
> Your weekend workouts also see a reduction in volume but retain their
> necessary intensity. You're first guided through a race simulation littered
> with a variety of efforts that also stays pretty lean on recovery between
> bouts of work (kinda like a bike race) and then you'll cap things off with a
> comparatively easy round of Sweet Spot over-unders that can be skipped in
> favor of Fletcher, Brasstown, Andrews or an outdoor ride.
> 
> This week can serve as a taper for any week leading into a B-priority weekend,
> so feel free to repeat this week anytime you want a bit more stress than next
> week's race-week format. Consider including an  _openers_  workout the day
> prior to your race, something like Truuli or its shorter versions. And if
> you're racing on Sunday, you can skip Saturday's scheduled workout in favor of
> the opener options just suggested if Diamond might leave you feeling too
> fatigued.

## Week 8

> Entering what’s likely to be your first of many Race weeks to come (assuming
> you’re not already racing), you’ll need to decide which workouts will take
> place indoors and which will be skipped in lieu of training races or higher-
> priority events.
> 
> You’ll also have to decide on the number of weeks that you’re looking to
> maintain your peak fitness since it typically begins to decline after 4-5
> weeks for most riders. Some riders can hold this fitness for longer periods,
> some for less. But in most cases, this race-week taper structure can be
> repeated quite often with only minor tweaking depending on your race schedule.
> 
> A weekday training race plus one of the scheduled workouts or simply the two
> reduced-volume workouts slated during this week will work well for most riders
> looking to shed a little more fatigue and stay sharp leading into the weekend.
> And keep or ditch the midweek recovery ride depending on just how useful you
> find it. There's also the option of an openers workout scheduled the day prior
> to your event, so this can require a bit of rearrangement each week such that
> you don't carry any residual fatigue into your important events.
> 
> Whatever you decide, try to allow for a day of rest or easy spinning following
> each day of training; the single exception is an openers workout, of course.
> That always takes place the day prior to your race or race weekend.
> 
> OK, you’ve done the work, you have the fitness, now go out there with
> confidence knowing that you’ve done everything necessary to get the job done.
> Good luck!
