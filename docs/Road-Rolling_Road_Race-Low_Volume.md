# Trainer Road Plan: Rolling Road Race - Low Volume

## Week 1

> Your first workout is likely to be your final FTP reassessment, at least for
> this training cycle. We'll need to account for improvement acquired during
> your Build training, but the steady weekly training load ahead won't merit
> further FTP monitoring since the focus is now more on refining your fitness
> and less on raising more basic work capacities. You’re free to use any
> assessment workout you prefer, but it’s recommended that you use the same one
> you’ve used up to this point.
> 
> Up next is few rounds of 40/20's that will simultaneously target your
> anaerobic capabilities while gradually increasing the stress on your aerobic
> system as each round progresses, all in an on-off format common to mass start
> racing.
> 
> Then, your first week closes with the first of many combination workouts aimed
> at melding your varied performance capabilities into a single workout thereby
> simulating many of the demands you'll face during competition. In this case,
> you'll face a pair of VO2max repeats with somewhat more challenging recovery
> valleys in between, several times over, similar to a repeated circuit.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

### Thursday 

* **Name**: Merced
* **Duration**: 1 hour
* **TSS**: 85.0
* **NP**: 184
* **IF**: 92%

**Description**:

> Merced is 5 sets of 5x40-seconds efforts at 135% FTP with very short,
> 20-second recoveries between them. The active recoveries between each set of
> 40/20's are a little over 4 minutes long.

### Saturday 

* **Name**: Diamond Valley Road Race +1
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 116.0
* **NP**: 176
* **IF**: 88%

**Description**:

> This 6-lap workout is a race simulation based on the make-or-break segment of
> a Carson/Tahoe/Reno road race course.
> 
> It begins with an initial effort lasting 2 minutes at 115% FTP, a brief
> 30-second active recovery, 2 minutes of Tempo work, and then a second 2-minute
> effort at 115% FTP that concludes with a 30-second kick at 120% FTP.
> 
> Recovery between each interval is 5 minutes long.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 2

> Week 2 begins with the first in a series of Anaerobic interval workouts aimed
> at growing your peak power outputs over several short but varied durations.
> Being able to dole out big watts isn't truly useful unless you can do it
> repeatedly without falling apart.
> 
> Up next, last week's workout demands grow by way of shorter, slightly less
> intense repeats in greater quantity. You'll repeat large chunks of 30/20's and
> do your best to cope with your waning anaerobic resources as your well-
> developed aerobic system takes up the slack. This multi-faceted assault
> maintains the theme of stressing multiple energy systems in manners similar to
> those encountered within a field of aggressive riders.
> 
> Your week closes with another combination workout that's a little more evenly
> divided between sustained power and high-end aerobic & anaerobic repeats. The
> idea here is to emulate the demands faced near the end of a race when the
> general fatigue is high and the race outcome hinges on your ability to
> repeatedly surge and recover.

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Striped
* **Duration**: 1 hour
* **TSS**: 80.0
* **NP**: 178

**Description**:

> Striped is composed of 3x16-minute sets that first step up from 15 seconds at
> 160% FTP to 30 seconds at 153% FTP to 45 seconds at 147% FTP and finally to 60
> seconds at 140% FTP before stepping back down in reverse order.
> 
> Recoveries following each interval are 3 times as long as the interval itself
> (1:3 work to rest ratio) so recoveries are short but relatively sufficient.

### Thursday 

* **Name**: Clouds Rest +1
* **Duration**: 1 hour
* **TSS**: 81.0
* **NP**: 180
* **IF**: 90%

**Description**:

### Saturday 

* **Name**: Winchell
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 121.0
* **NP**: 180
* **IF**: 90%

**Description**:

> Winchell is a combination workout that starts with 3 sets of 4-minute
> Threshold efforts at 95-105% FTP with active recoveries that increase in
> duration but also in intensity.
> 
> The second half of the workout is made up of 3 sets of 40/20's where you'll
> ride for 40 seconds at 120-130% FTP, rinse for 20 seconds, then repeat for 5
> short efforts per set of high-intensity repeats.
> 
> Recoveries between sets of 40/20's diminish from a little over 3 minutes to a
> little over 2 minutes.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 3

> Week 3 compares closely to last week, both in format and total training
> stress, starting with another round of Anaerobic repeats that step down in
> intensity, up in duration, then reverse the pattern. But this time, the
> durations are twice as long and the watts are nearly as sky-high as last
> week's anaerobic power workout.
> 
> This week's high-volume/low rest Anaerobic repeats are basically microbursts
> on steroids. Instead of 15 seconds on/15 seconds off, you'll have to repeat
> efforts twice that long with recoveries similarly twice as long as usual,
> several times over. Again, big power _don't mean a thang_ if you can't repeat
> it, a lot.
> 
> Your end-of-week race simulation is easily one of the cruelest formats in the
> entire TR catalog, but it's also on the short list of workouts that tell you
> that you're not just ready to race, you're ready to **crush** it. The early
> paceline repeats are far and away the bulk of the workout, so reserve your
> focus for them and then just hang in there as best you can during the
> comparatively invisible VO2max repeats.

> following these 3 intervals is 7 minutes in duration.
> 
> Part 2 of this workout consists of 2 sets of 3x2-minute VO2max intervals at
> 110-120% FTP with 2-minute active recoveries between each and 4 minutes of

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 4

> Recovery weeks are an opportunity to dial back the intensity, maintain your
> ride schedule, and heal from the previous weeks of training. Accordingly, the
> intensity is low for each of your rides this week with the exception of a
> small handful of very short sprint efforts that will keep your muscles firing
> on all cylinders without accumulating high amounts of counterproductive,
> performance-degrading stress.
> 
> If you feel as though you're truly rested and ready to resume your upward-
> performance trajectory by the weekend, feel free to do a bit of work on
> Saturday as long as it doesn't send you into week 5 carrying too much fatigue
> for your final round of high-intensity workouts.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 5

> As you work your way toward your taper and race weeks, the workouts grow
> increasingly specific to the often brutal demands of mass-start racing on
> punchy, rolling courses.
> 
> You're welcome to use today to reassess changes in your FTP, but due to the
> shift from a focus on building fitness to one on honing fitness, you may not
> see substantial changes in your FTP during this specialized phase of training.
> Alternatively, you can simply add 1-3% to your FTP if you suspect a slight
> bump in your Functional Threshold Power.
> 
> If you choose to skip the FTP reassessment, your first workout is the last one
> aimed solely at improving your anaerobic capacity while subsequent workouts
> will make use of the gains that follow this last assortment of short-duration,
> very high-power intervals. Do your best to complete each interval, even if
> that means minor reductions in the Target power.  
> 
> Up next is a workout that splits its aim between challenging your ability to
> sustain power slightly above your FTP as well as your ability to wind up huge
> watts for a short but relentless series of sprints all packed into some
> brutally challenging 2-minute efforts. Think of the closing minutes of any
> hotly contested race where you find yourself still in the hunt and you'll
> understand what we're trying to replicate here.
> 
> Then this week definitely saved the best for last. Broken Finger mashes
> together a pair of Coach Chad favorites that will demonstrate your ability to
> recover quickly, repeat high watts over and over, and then combine raw power
> with deep, foundational muscle endurance, all inside of 90 minutes.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 6

> Your final, full-volume week begins with your first of 3 weeks' worth of
> attack-and-recover brutality in the form of a workout named  _Huxley_. Each
> set within is  a mash-up of all things painful but also a great demonstration
> that you can, in fact, face almost anything. Make sure to get out of the
> saddle during the attacks as you take advantage of the high-end power you've
> built over the course of your Anaerobic interval workouts.
> 
> Then you'll experience what might be your first dance with Mr. Joe Devel but
> almost certainly won't be your last. This quartet of short/short intervals
> will see you repeating efforts anywhere from 120-150% of your FTP with never
> more than 15 blink-and-you'll-miss-them seconds of recovery between repeats.
> Chances are very strong that at least one of these sets will push your
> capabilities to their fullest extents buying you one final increase in your
> aerobic power capabilities.
> 
> Finally, you'll square off against another combination workout that first
> takes some of the wind out of your sails via some muscle-sapping anaerobic
> repeats á la Black Kaweah before capping things off with a couple of
> mercilessly long trips up to your VO2max. Survive this one and there's really
> nothing you'll face on race day that can possibly unhitch you.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 7

> Time to dial things back and let any further fitness buried underneath your
> fatigue begin to rise to the surface. We’ll keep the intensity, cut the volume
> way back, and start to gradually taper things down to a bare minimum that
> finds you as fresh as possible in about 2 weeks' time.
> 
> Both weekday workouts are trimmed down versions of what you saw last week
> aiming to keep your muscles and mind attuned to the intensity while reducing
> the overall training load in order to recover some freshness without
> sacrificing any fitness in the process.
> 
> Your weekend workout also sees a reduction in volume but retains its necessary
> intensity as you're guided through a race simulation littered with a variety
> of efforts and remains pretty lean on recovery between bouts of work, kinda
> like a bike race.
> 
> This week can serve as a taper for any week leading into a B-priority weekend,
> so feel free to repeat this week anytime you want a bit more stress than next
> week's race-week format. Consider including an _openers_ workout the day prior
> to your race, something  like Truuli or its shorter versions.

## Week 8

> Entering what’s likely to be your first of many Race weeks to come (assuming
> you’re not already racing), you’ll need to decide which workouts will take
> place indoors and which will be skipped in lieu of training races or higher-
> priority events.
> 
> You’ll also have to decide on the number of weeks that you’re looking to
> maintain your peak fitness since it typically begins to decline after 4-5
> weeks for most riders. Some riders can hold this fitness for longer periods,
> some for less. But in most cases, this race-week taper structure can be
> repeated quite often with only minor tweaking depending on your race schedule.
> 
> A weekday training race plus one of the scheduled workouts or simply the two
> reduced-volume workouts slated during before Friday will work well for most
> riders looking to shed a little more fatigue and stay sharp leading into the
> weekend. There's also the option of an openers workout scheduled the day prior
> to your event, and this can require a bit of rearrangement each week such that
> you don't carry any residual fatigue into your important events.
> 
> Whatever you decide, try to allow for a day of rest following each day of
> training - the single exception is an openers workout, since a race will
> always fall on the following day.
> 
> OK, you’ve done the work, you have the fitness, now go out there with
> confidence knowing that you’ve done everything necessary to get the job done.
