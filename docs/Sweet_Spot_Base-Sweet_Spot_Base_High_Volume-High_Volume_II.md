# Trainer Road Plan: Sweet Spot Base - High Volume II

> The Sweet Spot Base plans are foundation training plans that can serve as the
> basis for all training tracks offered by TrainerRoad.
> 
> The high-volume version of Sweet Spot Base II varies little from its
> predecessor in terms of intensity level but does grow the weekly volume at the
> same rate achieved in the previous block of training. All workouts are still
> aimed at increasing your ability to keep power to the pedals via improved
> muscle endurance and higher fatigue resistance over longer, and still quite
> demanding, but not overly exhausting workouts. This round of Sweet Spot
> training ranges from about 10-11 hours per week.
> 
> Much like last time, following your initial fitness assessment, you'll face 5
> weeks of work all targeted on that same narrow, specific range of power output
> except your Friday recovery ride. Week 6 again brings this phase of high-end
> base conditioning to a close with a week of low-intensity, aerobic Endurance
> workouts.

## Week 1

> Even with the inclusion of a comparatively low-TSS assessment workout to
> account for any improvement acquired during Sweet Spot Base I, Week 1
> progresses your workload at a rate very similar to that of your first half of
> this training phase. Picking up where week 5 left off, you'll jump right back
> into an intensive focus on raising your ability to dole out higher percentages
> of FTP for longer and longer durations.  
> 
> Looking for something a little less intense and don't mind some extra time in
> the saddle come Sunday? Have a look at Town Hill or something similar.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> While your weekend workouts will never rise above 2 hours in duration, your
> training load has to continuously progress and this is done via longer weekday
> Sweet Spot workouts. But not only are many of these repeat workouts, meaning
> you're already familiar with their demands, but they're also only marginally
> longer than your previous weekday workouts.
> 
> If you're not feeling up to another day in the Sweet Spot by the time you
> reach Sunday, try Big Squaw or Ptarmigan instead.

## Week 3

> No big surprises here. Week 3 maintains the same TSS ramp-rate that you're
> well accustomed to at this point in your 12-week base training phase. Keep up
> with the demands as well as you can, reserving a couple of go-to methods for
> slightly reducing the load. The first option is the omission or modification
> of your Friday aerobic endurance ride and the second is a 5% reduction in
> Workout Intensity during one, or at the most two, of your weekly Sweet Spot
> workouts.  
>   
> If you'd rather ride long and "easy" on Sunday, give Town Hill or Maclure a
> shot.
