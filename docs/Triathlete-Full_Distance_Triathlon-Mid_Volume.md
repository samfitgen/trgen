# Trainer Road Plan: Full Distance Triathlon - Mid Volume

## Wk1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base + Threshold Intervals (3300m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 10x25m SC Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 7x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 45s rest between
> intervals; 10x25m K &R drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
> RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Ramp Test** It's pretty likely you've seen some improvement over
> the course of your Build phase, so we'll begin this specialized training phase
> by reassessing your FTP such that the final weeks leading up to your most
> important races are appropriately demanding and as productive as possible. Use
> the same test format you've used before, and make sure you feel rested and
> motivated heading into this workout.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Tempo Run** Run 10min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE6 to warm up, then
> run steadily, Moderate-Hard, RPE8 for just 35 minutes this week before cooling
> down for 10 minutes at an Easy, RPE 4pace for a total of 55 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Brick Workout** Polar Bear + 60min Base Run: Begin with a 2-hour
> bike workout where you'll sustain 1hr45min of effort between 80-85% FTP before
> transitioning into a 60-minute run at an Easy-Moderate RPE6 pace for a
> demanding but not overly taxing run off the bike,
> 
> _Friday_ **Whorl** Each of the 8 weeks ahead is likely to end in this workout
> or one very similar to it. Use this ride to accumulate a little extra aerobic
> endurance work, to practice and refine your aero positioning, and to keep your
> muscles pliable and reasonably refreshed. And always feel free to trim the
> duration of this workout if you recognize that you're carrying too much
> fatigue into a demanding weekend of training.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Base + VO2max + Speed Intervals (3150)** Warm-Up 350m Easy,
> RPE4; 10x25m F Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6

> 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Kailash** Having finished up with a 4.5-hour endurance ride
> during your Build training, this first long ride ups your time in the saddle
> slightly with the twin goals of furthering your aerobic endurance and
> familiarizing you with the many challenges that accompany these long, steady-
> effort rides.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Recovery Run** Later in the day, run 45 minutes at an Easy, RPE
> 4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (4000m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE 4; 3200m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 400m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Bump up your longest run yet again by running

### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> 
> _Tuesday_ **Frissell +2** Same rules as last week regarding riding in your
> aero position: only do so if you can keep your power on Target. Because the
