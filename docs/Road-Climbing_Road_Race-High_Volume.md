# Trainer Road Plan: Climbing Road Race - High Volume

> Shaping a capable road racer -- whose events require everything from short,
> near maximal efforts to all-out bursts of speed to long stretches of endurance
> work and, in this case, multiple bouts of sustained climbing -- requires a
> plan that hones the entire spectrum of performance capabilities.
> 
> Accordingly, the emphasis is split between high-power, often explosive efforts
> and extended, near-FTP efforts that all find their way into a road race,
> beginning, middle or end, flats or climbs, pointless or purposeful.
> 
> The high-volume version of the Climbing Road Race specialty plan has riders on
> the bike 6 times each week for 60-120 minutes up until weeks 7 and 8 which
> provide taper formats that can be repeated during a busy race season.
> Typically, B-priority events go well following Week 7's format while Week 8's
> even lower volume lends itself nicely to A-priority weekends.
> 
> Substitute any outdoor races or training rides for your scheduled workouts
> when appropriate, but do your best to make these substitutions at least as
> challenging as the workout you're skipping.

## Week 1

> As per usual, your season's final bout of training begins with an opportunity
> to assess improvements in your sustainable power in order to accurately adjust
> your power levels. While the Ramp Test is recommended, you're welcome to use
> the 20 Minute FTP Test of the 8 Minute FTP Test if that's your preference.
> 
> Following your FTP reassessment, your midweek Endurance ride is unusually long
> this week to make up for your shorter assessment workout. If you want to
> shorten this up, feel free to directly follow your assessment with something
> like Pettit or Bald Knob. Then, you’ll get your first dose of sustained,
> suprathreshold climbing repeats where you’ll begin to practice the art of
> repeated climbing surges.
> 
> Following an end-of-week standard - a 60-minute aerobic Endurance ride - your
> weekend begins with a race-fashioned workout that begins and ends with some
> high-power sprints to keep your  _big-watts_  capabilities sharp while the
> remainder of the workout consists of less intense, fairly long muscle
> endurance repeats which are separated by just enough time to clear your head
> but perhaps not your muscles. You’ll know if your aerobic engine is firing on
> all cylinders based on how ready you feel for each subsequent interval.
> 
> Then you’ll cap off your first week with a straightforward round of Sweet
> Spot/Threshold repeats at percentages of FTP commonly utilized during many
> race-intensity, sustained climbs. Prefer to ride longer and slower while still
> accumulating the same TSS? Try Maclure or Ptarmigan +1 or even head outdoors
> and keep things reasonably easy while you rack up your target TSS.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> Week 2 begins with a series of varied  _attack & recover_ intervals that ask
> you to bounce back and forth between hard work and all-out effort with only
> brief recoveries between these short intervals thereby simulating the
> tumultuous barrage of efforts seen during any aggressive road race.
> 
> Following your now consistently short, weekday Endurance ride, you'll grow
> last week's performance at intensities just above FTP by adding a little more
> duration to each repeat and a little more volume to the workout as a whole.
> These efforts are bent on furthering your ability to sustain slightly supra-
> threshold watts and eke out any final increases in your longer-term
> sustainable power.
> 
> Enjoy an easy Friday spin and then the weekend starts with a near repeat of
> last week's race-like ride where you'll again bang out some early sprint
> practice before settling into a handful of reasonably lengthy stretches of
> Sweet Spot & Threshold training. Finally, you'll see what sort of sprint you
> can muster when the fatigue is at its highest since this workout also closes
> with a couple late-workout sprints.
> 
> The weekend then ends with another round of strength-endurance building Sweet
> Spot repeats that can be skipped in favor of some longer, lower-intensity work
> like last weekend's alternatives, Maclure or Ptarmigan +1.

## Week 3

> Week 3 starts with another jam-packed workout consisting of initial hard
> charges that dovetail into near-Threshold work in order to familiarize you
> with the process of doling out big, anaerobically inclined efforts followed
> immediately by some  _legs-don't-fail-me-now_  sustained watts. Intervals like
> these and last week's mixed-format efforts cultivate a rider resistant to
> shameful 'attack & explode' antics. Nobody wants to be the one who jumps away
> from the field only to fall apart a minute or two later.  
>   
> Up next, your usual weekday Endurance ride is followed the next day by the
> final duration increase in your suprathreshold efforts that ask you to stay a
> little above your FTP for the longest stretches of time yet. But master these
> multi-minute repeats and watch as even your most motivated competitors fall
> off your wheel as you hit 'em again and again.  
>   
> After your second, short Endurance ride, this third weekend starts with more
> strength-endurance work bookended by sky-high surges to keep your sprint sharp
> and your ability to endure high watts fully intact and then concludes with
> some longer (but segmented!) Sweet Spot repeats aimed at furthering your
> ability to keep high power to the pedals for long stretches of time. Same
> alternative options as the last couple weeks: Maclure, Ptarmigan +1 or a
> similar-TSS outdoor ride kept in that butter-burning power range between
> 60-80% FTP.

> performance trajectory by the weekend, feel free to do a bit of work over the
> weekend, preferably Saturday, as long as it doesn't send you into week 5
> carrying too much fatigue for your final round of high-intensity workouts.

### Sunday 

* **Name**: Springer Mountain
* **Duration**: 2 hours
* **TSS**: 104.0
* **NP**: 144
* **IF**: 72%

**Description**:

> 2 hours of Tempo intervals spent between 70-80% FTP with brief, intermittent,
> 1 to 3-minute recoveries at 55% FTP. This workout also includes 3x10s Strength
> Sprints, 5-minutes between each as well as some Endurance Spinning intervals
> and some Single-Leg Focus drills.
> 
> Strength Sprints: Practice turning a big gear as forcefully as possible in
> order to recruit as many muscle fibers as you can. From a near stop and in the
> biggest gear you can gracefully turn over without exceeding 90rpm in 12
> pedalstrokes, stand and hold onto your handlebar drops while driving each foot
> down as hard as you can. Maintain excellent form and if you reach 90rpm inside
> of 12 pedalstrokes, choose a larger gear next time. **Note: When using a load-
> restricted trainer like a CompuTrainer or KICKR, consider switching to Slope
> Mode for your Strength Sprints.
> 
> Endurance Spinning: Practice spinning slightly quicker than your natural,
> self-selected cadence. Ride at a cadence that's at the very top of your
> comfortable rpm range and remain there for a solid 5 minutes. The goal is to
> learn to turn the pedals more quickly with less force (muscle stress) thereby
> improving your ability to remain predominantly aerobic over a wide range of
> rpm's. If your HR rises more than a few BPM, you're pedaling too quickly -
> take it easy and stay relaxed but quick.
> 
> Single-Leg Focus: The objective here is to learn to more effectively apply
> power through the entire pedalstroke by focusing strictly on one leg's
> activity through the bottom, upstroke, and over the top of the pedalstroke.
> For 90 seconds at a time, devote your attention to one leg before switching to
> the other. Your cadence may fall slightly, but these drills typically come
> more naturally to less experienced "one-leggers". Pay particular attention to
> lightly pulling your foot across the bottom, lifting your knee lightly upward
> and then softly kicking over the top of each pedalstroke. Add this drill
> indoors or outdoors as often as you like, more frequently if you recognize a
> substantial difference in one leg's strength or coordination.

## Week 5

> As you work your way toward your taper and race weeks, the workouts grow
> increasingly specific to the often brutal demands of mass-start racing on
> punchy, rolling courses.
> 
> You're welcome to use today to reassess changes in your FTP, but due to the
> shift from a focus on building fitness to one on honing fitness, you may not
> see substantial changes in your FTP during this specialized phase of training.
> Alternatively, you can simply add 1-3% to your FTP if you suspect a slight
> bump in your Functional Threshold Power.
> 
> If you choose to skip the FTP reassessment, your first workout is what would
> otherwise be a straightforward set of Threshold repeats except that each
> interval is sprinkled with very short and sharp bursts of power that serve to
> keep your fast-twitch fibers alert and available but also to familiarize you
> with the skill of surging briefly without falling off the pace afterward.
> 
> Following another short, midweek aerobic Endurance spin, you'll face a
> continuous blend of race-related efforts that cover the full spectrum of
> effort levels (omitting the really short, super hard sprints you covered
> earlier this week). This is a perfect opportunity to see how well you handle
> over an hour's worth of high-intensity randomness similar to what you'd face
> during a fairly energized uphill road race.
> 
> After a quick, easy spin, the weekend is ushered in by your first of a few
> progression workouts. This format lumps together several suprathreshold
> efforts separated by minimal amounts of rest keeping things similar to the
> escalating intensity of a race. They also pay due attention to the energy
> system responsible for rapid recovery following each above-FTP effort as well
> the system responsible for laying down big watts - your aerobic (fat burning)
> and anaerobic (sugar burning) engines, respectively.
> 
> Finally, your Sweet Spot repeats near their duration peak and can again be
> swapped out in favor of something similar in TSS but lower in intensity. Some
> new options are available - Big Squaw or plain ol' Ptarmigan \- but if you've
> yet to head outdoors and spend some time climbing or at least bullying back
> some stiff wind, give this option some serious consideration.

## Week 6

> Week 6 begins a soon-to-be-familiar pattern of work as each workout remains
> the same in nature but decreases substantially in volume, starting with your
> first workout of the week and its  _surge & attack_ efforts. The goal with
> each interval is to give it nearly everything you have as the effort required
> only ascends reaching a brief crescendo of all-out misery. Think anyone else
> is working this hard?
> 
> Following another hour-long Endurance ride, things get toned down closer to
> your FTP while still including a fair amount of work done near your VO2max.
> What's more, the oh-so-short recoveries between each interval will keep your
> heart, lungs, and muscles primed and ready for the next effort thereby taking
> full advantage of the robust aerobic system you've built over weeks and weeks
> of hard work.
> 
> Get through your very last hour-long, aerobic Endurance spin, and your weekend
> serves up a similar weekend combination starting with a progression workout
> which this time includes slightly shorter recovery valleys placing a greater
> reliance on your aerobic system's ability to clear the junk and process the
> usable excesses. That same aerobic engine is then taxed at the end of the
> workout in another manner: long, slow, steady effort.
> 
> This weekend then concludes with one last round of arguably too-long Sweet
> Spot jobbers that can be ditched in lieu of usual-suspect Maclure or perhaps
> Flattop if you want to include a couple sprints.

## Week 8

> Entering what’s likely to be your first of many Race weeks to come (assuming
> you’re not already racing), you’ll need to decide which workouts will take
> place indoors and which will be skipped in lieu of training races or higher-
> priority events.
> 
> You’ll also have to decide on the number of weeks that you’re looking to
> maintain your peak fitness since it typically begins to decline after 4-5
> weeks for most riders. Some riders can hold this fitness for longer periods,
> some for less. But in most cases, this race-week taper structure can be
> repeated quite often with only minor tweaking depending on your race schedule.
> 
> A weekday training race plus one of the scheduled weekday workouts or simply
> the two reduced-volume workouts slated before Friday (the weekday Endurance
> rides are optional but make for good recovery rides) will work well for most
> riders looking to shed a little more fatigue and stay sharp leading into the
> weekend. There's also the option of an  _openers_  workout scheduled the day
> prior to your event, and this can require a bit of rearrangement each week
> such that you don't carry any residual fatigue into your important events.
> 
> Whatever you decide, try to allow for a day of rest or easy riding following
> each day of training - the single exception is an openers workout since a race
> will always fall on the following day.
> 
> OK, you’ve done the work, you have the fitness, now go out there with
> confidence knowing that you’ve done everything necessary to get the job done.
> Good luck!
