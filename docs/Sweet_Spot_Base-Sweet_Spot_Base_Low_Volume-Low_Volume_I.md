# Trainer Road Plan: Sweet Spot Base - Low Volume I

> The Sweet Spot Base plans are foundation training plans that can serve as the
> basis for all training tracks offered by TrainerRoad.
> 
> The low-volume version of Sweet Spot Base I serves as annual opportunity to
> revisit the form work that often gets neglected as the cycling season
> progresses.  It helps establish the aerobic fitness foundation upon which
> you'll build your season's top fitness in less than 4 hours each week.  
> 
> Following the initial fitness assessment, Sweet Spot Base I emphasizes pedal
> economy - via leg speed, speed endurance and varied cadence - as well as base
> aerobic fitness via a healthy dose of Sweet Spot training aimed at making
> every minute of your indoor endeavors count.

## Week 1

> This first week is dedicated to assessing your current fitness, somewhat
> familiarizing you with the Sweet Spot intensity level and then dialing back
> the intensity to work on your pedaling form during the longer weekend ride.

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!
