# Trainer Road Plan: Cross-Country Olympic - Low Volume

> The Cross-Country Olympic MTB plans will prepare you for the widely varied and
> typically high-intensity nature of XC racing by combining a focus on short,
> highly repeatable bursts of power coupled with efforts bent on driving up the
> watts and keeping them high for extended lengths of time.
> 
> As the nature of off-road racing is often unpredictable with terrain that can
> veer from wide open fire road to technical, rocky singletrack--all on subtle
> to severe grades--cultivating a well-rounded rider with a wide-ranging set of
> capabilities is the goal of each version of this plan.

## Week 1

> Week 1 gets you rolling with an ever-present FTP assessment to account for any
> recent improvements in your sustainable power via our Ramp Test. You're
> welcome to use either the 20 Minute FTP Test or the 8 Minute FTP Test if
> that's your preference. In any case, try to have a day or two of recovery in
> your legs and feel ready to fairly demonstrate your current level of fitness.
> If not, consider riding easy today and postponing your assessment until
> tomorrow.  
> 
> The second workout of the week aims to keep its format as close to that of an
> aggressive XC race as possible. With short, punchy VO2max efforts spaced
> across several rounds of Sweet Spot intervals, this type of work targets
> numerous race-day demands as it grows your aerobic and anaerobic fitness
> simultaneously.
> 
> Finally, a round of hard-start Threshold efforts will accomplish three goals.
> First, you'll target your ability to generate _real big_ watts. Second, you'll
> tackle some muscle endurance work up at the high end of your current
> sustainable capabilities. Third, you'll have the opportunity to confirm your
> FTP assessment results many times over.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

* **Name**: Bear -2
* **Duration**: 1 hour

**Description**:

> Bear -2 is 5 sets lasting about 5 minutes each consisting of 7x25-second
> VO2max repeats where you'll ride for 25 seconds at 125% FTP and then float at
> 88% FTP for 15-30 seconds in between.
>

* **IF**: 90%

**Description**:

> Augusta is made up of 4x15-minute hard-start intervals.
>

> 
> Each interval is separated by 3 minutes of recovery.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 2

> Riding above FTP is tremendously productive, and it's also tremendously
> taxing. But by trimming down the interval durations and inserting short but
> adequate recovery valleys, you can accumulate quite a lot of time at this
> tough but productive output level without exhausting your muscles excessively.
> 
> Up next is a workout very similar to last week's. This affords an opportunity
> to improve on something you may have struggled with, or it allows you to dress
> things up a bit. Maybe you'll spend some of the VO2max surges out of the
> saddle. Maybe you'll vary your cadence during a short burst or two every
> round. Or maybe you'll simply try to make each acceleration as smooth as
> possible thereby conserving as much energy as you can.
> 
> Lastly, last week's already long muscle endurance repeats grow even longer. If
> you find yourself in a bad spot, consider an occasional backpedal (no more
> than 30 seconds, and no more than 2 per interval) in order to keep your
> productivity and your cadence lifted. Think "smooth power", even if that means
> an infrequent and short impromptu recovery.

Rest Day

## Week 3

> What can be said about week 3 except that everything gets just a little bit
> longer? This theme commences with one extra round of slightly-supra-threshold
> work where you'll continue to challenge your current sustainable power limits
> as you manage the accumulating fatigue without easing up.
> 
> Then your race-simulating VO2max + Sweet Spot intervals grow ever so slightly
> in duration but retain every bit of their relentless _on/barely off/on_
> pattern of muscle and lung abuse.  
> 
> This pre-recovery-week round of workouts then bestows upon thee an opportunity
> to make good use of that ever-reliable backpedal tactic, should you need it.
> By drawing each post-sprint Threshold effort out to a full half hour, you're
> sure to occasionally question your ability to endure the discomfort as you
> reinforce your rising ability to withstand high, but not too-high, watts.

Rest Day

## Week 4

> Time to let the last few weeks of training soak in over the course of an easy
> week of riding. During this week, try not to lose sight of the fact that
> **adaptation happens during recovery** , not during the often muscle-damaging
> doses of high-intensity training that comprised much of the last few weeks.
> 
> Until you firmly grasp the benefit of proper and adequate recovery, only hard
> lessons await you out on the trail. If, however, you've recognized the benefit
> of recovery done correctly, you'll happily abide the low-intensity, same-
> training-schedule nature of this easy week.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 5

> With rested legs and a reinvigorated mind, it’s time for some new workout
> formats to further broaden your base of capabilities and to start to put a
> point on your high-level forms of fitness. Up first, a round of short but
> densely packed anaerobic repeats that grow increasingly aerobic as each set
> progresses thereby affording you the best of a couple worlds.
> 
> Up next, you'll couple your hard-start prowess with your ability to
> accelerate, relent only slightly, then hit it hard again...and again, and
> again. Each set will cover a lot of different bases as several types of
> physical stress overlap one another in a very race-like manner.
> 
> Then, week 5 closes with some extended and varied Sweet Spot work preceded by
> a short flurry of all-out sprint efforts. Use these to simulate the early
> demands of any XC race where positioning for pivotal course segments can come
> down to a single explosive burst of power.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 6

> First off, your _anaerobic-aerobic_ repeats grow in duration but stay at their
> same high intensity. Stands to reason that if you struggled with this wattage
> for a shorter duration, a slight drop in target power is in order for these
> longer jobbers. Remember, it's not about survival, it's about productivity.
> Performing 7 high-power minutes steadily and with proper pedaling mechanics is
> far superior training than 7 minutes of fighting the bike and repeatedly
> falling apart during the final 30 seconds.  
>   
> Then, this week's iteration of hard starts + VO2max race repeats simply ups
> the demand of the initial sprint while leaving the rest of each interval the
> same. While this could inspire slightly greater fatigue during the initial
> handful of surges, it's temporary fatigue that you can probably ride right
> through - as long as you tough it out long enough.  
>   
> Your week then closes with a workout very, very similar to last week's mixed
> bag of race-like efforts. Do your best to muster some solid sprint efforts
> early on, in excess of the target watts **if** you feel up to the challenge,
> and then make the various steady-state efforts as smooth and seemingly
> effortless as possible. Look relaxed, be relaxed.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 7

> Your final _full-strength_ week of Specialty training begins with a workout
> very similar to last week's but with one crucial change: less recovery between
> intervals. The intensity remains the same, the workload does too, but this
> will feel entirely different than last week's version. This recovery reduction
> increases the aerobic demand earlier in each set considering the limited
> replenishment of your anaerobic resources. Translation: your aerobic engine
> will be firing on all cylinders toward the end of each set while your
> anaerobic power wanes.
> 
> Then it's onto another round of a now familiar combination workout. But this
> week the severity of the sprints declines a bit in the interest of allowing
> your fast-twitch fibers to rebound a little more quickly and rest up in
> anticipation of your peak event(s).
> 
> This final, pre-taper week then closes out with another round of sprints +
> Sweet Spot work aimed once again at recreating the random yet somewhat
> predictable nature of bike racing on trails.

## Week 8

> With your peak fitness and events on the immediate horizon, it’s time to pull
> you up from the depths of your fatigue and sharpen your fitness. To this end,
> you’ll face reduced-load workouts very similar in format to recent
> corresponding workouts. The difference will be evident in the reduced volume,
> but that’s where the reductions end as all of the intensity is necessarily
> maintained.
> 
> Saturday is an  _openers_  workout based on a Sunday race, but if your race
> falls on Saturday or perhaps both weekend days, perform the short priming
> workout on Friday instead. If you'd prefer a different openers workout, take a
> look at Scott Peak or the other versions of Truuli.
> 
> If for some reason you aren't racing this weekend, it's a good idea to slot in
> a repeat of one of your harder, weekend workouts in place of an outdoor race.
> Or get out on the trail for something equally intense and of similar duration
> as your upcoming event(s).
> 
> Otherwise, go toe the start line with a rested and primed body along with a
> confident and refreshed state of mind. You’ve done the work, now go out there
