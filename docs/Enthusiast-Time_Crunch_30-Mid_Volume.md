# Trainer Road Plan: Time Crunch 30 - Mid Volume

> The Time-Crunched training plans aim to provide a useful yet brief training
> structure for riders on very limited training schedules. Alternatively, riders
> on higher-volume plans can cherrypick Time-Crunched versions of their
> prescribed workouts or simply find a TC workout with similar goals when
> training time is in short supply.
> 
> Each week is built around 3-5 half-hour workouts consisting exclusively of
> high-intensity intervals that will warm the rider briefly, offer a challenging
> but necessarily short main set and then a very short cooldown. Both the
> warmups & cooldowns can be extended based on time availability - extending
> your warmup is our recommendation if you have a little time to spare - but if
> all you have is 30 minutes of ride time, you’ll be hard-pressed to find better
> workouts than these.
> 
> The mid-volume version of the Time Crunched training plan has you on the bike
> 5 days out of 7 reserving the remaining 2 days for recovery. And while this
> plan is laid out in a Tue/Wed/Thu & Sat/Sun schedule, rider’s are welcome to
> rearrange their days off as they see fit.
> 
> These plans have zero recovery weeks and are not progressive in nature, i.e.
> their TSS’s do not increase each week; rather, every week averages around 40
> TSS per half-hour workout. But the intensity of every workout is on the high
> side in order to compensate for less time in the saddle - short, sweet &
> painful.
> 
> Will this plan make you stronger? Very probably, especially if you previously
> lacked structure or consistency. Will it make you a top competitor? Probably
> not, considering you’re on the bike for 2.5 hours per week. They will,
> however, help already fit riders hold much of their competitive edge on far
> less weekly time than they devote in less time-crunched weeks & months.
> 
> Short on time or short on indoor-patience, the Time Crunched training plans
> could well be the best solution for riders who like to suffer but simply don’t
> have the time to do it.

## Week 1

> Right out of the gates, the first workout of your first week drops you right
> into a round of unforgiving VO2 Max repeats with minimal recovery time. But
> who needs to breathe anyway?
> 
> If you're coming into this block with no recent estimate of your on-the-bike
> fitness, swap this workout for the Ramp Test. Or if you prefer, either the 8
> Minute FTP Test or the 20 Minute FTP Test will work, and they'll be the only
> hour-long workout of this entire training block.  
> 
> Following a mid-week form workout, you’re up against an even less forgiving
> interval format because your third workout of this first week will address
> muscle endurance and good ol’ fashioned strength as you ascend a few rounds of
> power steps.  
> 
> Finally, you’ll start to close your first week with a coach-favorite, a few
> "sprint-erval" repeats where you’ll prep your muscles with some preliminary
> sprints before targeting muscle endurance by holding your threshold power plus
> a few extra watts, but who’s counting?
> 
> Then the icing on this week’s pain-cake takes the shape of 3 sets of Anaerobic
> capacity repeats to help develop or further your ability to lay down the high-
> power smackdown often & repeatedly.

> imagine.
> 
> Following your midweek Sweet Spot workout, your third workout of Week 2
> consists of a slightly unusual take on over-unders but one that maintains the
> aim of improving your sustainable power by forcing you to work in close
> proximity to your FTP, whether slightly above or slightly below.
> 
> In order to further this week’s muscle trauma onslaught, the weekend first
> sees you tacking some truly high-intensity efforts but with substantially more
> recovery time between them, relatively speaking of course, in order to boost
> your short power and unload any headspace baggage you’ve accumulated over the
> week thus far.
> 
> And wrapping things up is easily one of TR’s cruelest time-crunched creations,
> ramping team time trial repeats. You’re gonna LOVE ‘em!

> we’ll eeease you into the world of oxygen deprivation with reasonably short
> 2-minute efforts.
> 
> This week closes first with a round of tried & true over-under intervals to
> remind you how subtle an increase in effort it takes to flood your muscles
> when you’re riding that fine line between "not hard enough" & "too hard". Oh,
> and they’ll improve your lactate tolerance too.
> 
> Then things finally wrap up with some maddeningly muscle fatiguing exercises
> in pain-patience that have you oh so gradually stepping toward & then away
> from total muscle failure, twice.

> 
> Get your weekly Sweet Spot work under your belt and then it’s onto 3 grisly

## Week 5

> Another week, another round of abuse. This one eases into things with what
> might be your "easiest" undertaking to date, 30-second Billats. But feel free
> to bump up the Workout Intensity a bit if you’ve grown accustomed to a certain
> level of suffering by now.
> 
> Then you’ll take things "easy" during another Sweet Spot/form workout before
> it’s onto some straightforward Threshold work where you won’t even exceed your
> FTP…except when you do. Because every minute you’re goaded into a short but
> all-out sprint to not only keep you awake, but more importantly, to keep your
> muscles crackling with an unrelenting eagerness to go fast!
> 
> Cap the week off starting with some race-simulation efforts that ask you to
> attack and attack and attack (and rest occasionally) and you’ll be ready to
> tear the legs off any other rider training less than two and a half hours a
> week - we promise.
> 
> And the cherry on top of this week’s sundae of short-term suffering is a
> smattering of VO2 Max repeats of the 3-minute variety. Start your deep

> comes in the form of a seemingly innocuous little guy who isn’t high on flash
> but promises to sock you in the gut if you underestimate him. Work on growing
