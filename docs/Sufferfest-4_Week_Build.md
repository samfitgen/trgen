# Trainer Road Plan: Sufferfest Build

> This plan can be used by any rider, at any time of year, for the simple
> purpose of building fitness toward an upcoming goal of your own - and it does
> it based almost entirely on Sufferfest’s video workouts.
> 
> This plan will put you on the bike 6 days during each of the first 3 weeks,
> and each of these weeks includes 3 days of intensity while the rest consists
> of easy recovery rides or moderate aerobic endurance work. Altogether, this
> doozie of a training plan will acquaint you with the demands and benefits of
> several consecutive days in the saddle. The final week of this month-long plan
> will rest you up & peak your fitness just in time to fold its final two days
> into a race or event weekend!
> 
> If you already own each of these Sufferfest videos, you’re ready to jump right
> in; otherwise, you can purchase them from TheSufferfest.com and simply drag &
> drop the videos into your TrainerRoad player. And you can even take part in
> this training plan without a single video purchase because each of these
> workouts is already included in your monthly subscription fee. But take it
> from us and try out at least one of the videos to understand how entertaining
> and exciting the ample suffering - and the fitness that comes with it - can
> actually be!

## Week 1

> The first week of the Sufferfest Build plan will start with an opportunity to
> get an idea of your sustainable power via Sufferfest’s 20-minute Test, ‘Rubber
> Glove’. Alternatively, you can use TrainerRoad’s 8 Minute Test or 20 Minute
> Test if you’d prefer, perhaps to maintain consistency with previous
> assessments. You'll then alternate easy days with hard days heading toward the
> weekend with your second high-intensity workout pitting you against some
> sustained climbing with a number of short, hard efforts mixed in via a workout
> called ‘The Hunted’. The weekend trend will be hard day + long day, and this
> first week is no exception kicking off with the time trial/race combination
> ‘Local Hero’. Your week-ending, long aerobic endurance ride will give you the
> chance to ride out some of the fatigue at lower intensity while thoroughly
> taxing your aerobic engine.

> Wallone. This officially licensed footage from the ASO is all packaged around

> 
> Endurance. Turbo trainers. The thought of developing the first on the second

> device. Even our Minions, who love indoor training, have always struggled to
> stay on the trainer after our one hour Sufferfest videos finish. Not any more.
> Blender changes everything. This is the video that softens you up, takes you
> to the edge of exhaustion, sneaks up behind you and kicks you over that edge
> and down the hill, then makes you run up while being chased by a raving mob

## Week 3

> Week 3 of our Sufferfest Build plan will start with a round of 4-minute, high-
> intensity intervals encapsulated in Sufferfest’s ‘A Very Dark Place’. Scared?
> You should be because following AVDP and an easy day of spinning out your legs
> you’ll face a short but intense speed workout called ‘There Is No Try’ which
> will thoroughly fry your legs and leave you lamenting the loss of your will to
> fight and worried that even Friday’s easy recovery ride may feel like a tall
> order - and if so, skip it and take Friday completely off the bike because you
> may need the rest if you’re going to survive the weekend. The weekend training
> trend holds true through this final build week by first throwing Sufferfest’s
> second most brutal (yup, it somehow gets worse than this) workout your way as
> you face a barrage of efforts tidily contained within a name almost as long as
> the workout itself, ‘It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time’, or more
> concisely, ‘ISLAGIATT’. Your final long, aerobic endurance ride of this
> training plan will nudge the duration up another 15 minutes bestowing upon you
> a second chance to spin continuously for 2 full hours on the heels of
> yesterday’s far more varied 120-minute workout.

> usually finish with a sprint.
>

## Week 4

> Week 4 of our Sufferfest Build plan will cut the workload way, way down in
> order to allow your body to absorb the stress of the opening 3 weeks, but it
> will still dose you with just enough intensity with ‘Revolver’ to keep you
> sharp both physiologically and, arguably more importantly, psychologically
> before you hit your final, brief priming workout on Friday, ‘Extra Shot’, just
> prior to the start of a Tour of Sufferlandria or race/event weekend. Go forth,
> be brave & confident having survived the 4 brutal weeks that thrashed your
> legs, almost popped your heart, and perhaps even broke your will to live
