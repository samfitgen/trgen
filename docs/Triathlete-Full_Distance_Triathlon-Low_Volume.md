# Trainer Road Plan: Full Distance Triathlon - Low Volume

> Establishing base fitness paves the way for workloads that are heaped higher &
> higher during build training. With both forms of conditioning buttoned up, the
> intent is now to top off your fitness, uncover a high level of freshness and
> lock down your confidence over these final 8 weeks of training.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Ramp Test** It's pretty likely you've seen some improvement over
> the course of your Build phase, so we'll begin this specialized training phase
> by reassessing your FTP such that the final weeks leading up to your most
> important races are appropriately demanding and as productive as possible. Use
> the same test format you've used before, and make sure you feel rested and
> motivated heading into this workout.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base + Threshold Intervals (2800m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m SC Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6
> w/ 5s rest between intervals; 6x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 45s rest between
> intervals; 8x25m K &R drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy,
> RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Tempo Run** Run 10min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE6 to warm up, then
> run steadily, Moderate-Hard, RPE8 for just 30 minutes before cooling down for
> 10 minutes at an Easy, RPE4 pace for a total of 50 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **White** Working steadily for 70 minutes - truly steadily
> considering the unrelenting nature of indoor trainers - is often surprisingly
> difficult for many riders. If, however, you wish to further the challenge and
> lift your weekly training load a little or perhaps you're targeting a higher
> power % during the bike leg of your race(s), check out the +1 and +2 versions
> of this same workout.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Base + VO2max + Speed Intervals (2700m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m F Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 4x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/
> 5s rest between intervals; 6x150m Hard, RPE9 w/ 75s rest between intervals;
> 8x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between sprints; 8x25m K drills w/
> 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Friday_ **Recovery Run + Strides** Run an Easy 60 minutes at RPE4 pace with
> 8x20-second relaxed, mid-run sprints at RPE10 with 40 seconds of rest after
> each.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Putuo** Having finished up with a 4-hour endurance ride during
> your Build training, this first long ride ups your time in the saddle slightly
> with the twin goals of furthering your aerobic endurance and familiarizing you
> with the many challenges that accompany these long, steady-effort rides.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Swim Time Trial (3800m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE 4; 3200m Hard, RPE
> 9; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Kick off your first weekend by bumping up your
> longest run to 2hr40min at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6 pace.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 3

> _Tuesday_ **Stromlo +1** Same rules as last week regarding riding in your aero
> position: only do so if you can keep your power on Target. Because the primary
> goal is raising your high-end endurance even more over these final weeks of
> training, and this is best accomplished by pushing your current boundaries
> with fairly short, uncomfortable but sustainable intervals - and ones that are
> a little longer than last week's.

> 
> _Thursday_ **Echo** If you played with some slightly higher sustained watts
> last Thursday, you can see if those power outputs carry into this even longer
> batch of no-rest intervals via the +1  & +2 versions of Echo, always reserving
> the option for a short backpedal break should you find yourself fading from
> time to time. Whichever version you choose, make sure you're spending ample

> hours this week which can equate to something closer to 6-7 hours of ride time
> outdoors. Does that mean you can shorten this ride if you choose to do it
> indoors' Perhaps, but knowing that you can hunker down and keep the pedals

> seem that much less intimidating, that much more manageable.

## Week 5

> _Tuesday_ **Elwell** This assortment of efforts devotes a little time to each
> of the supra-threshold power outputs you've employed over prior weeks in order
> to lift your sustainable power. But at this point in your training, the goal
> shifts from building capabilities toward maintaining them while gradually
> shedding some of the residual fatigue they brought on.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base + Threshold Intervals (2800m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m SC Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6
> w/ 5s rest between intervals; 7x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 45s rest between
> intervals; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Tempo Run** Run 10min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE6 to warm up, then
> run steadily, Moderate-Hard, RPE8 for just 40 minutes before cooling down for
> 10 minutes at an Easy, RPE4 pace for a total of 60 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Ragged** During your introduction to this exhaustive workout
> format, each step asks that you endure your efforts for fairly long interval
> durations thereby increasing your ability to sustain higher speeds for longer
> and longer spans of time. Stay aero as much as possible, but sit up when
> you're considering a backpedal break. Often enough, just riding tall for a
> minute or two is all that's really necessary to keep the pedals turning over.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Base + VO2max + Speed Intervals (2800m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m F Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 3x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/
> 5s rest between intervals; 7x150m Hard, RPE9 w/ 75s rest between intervals;

> 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Friday_ **Recovery Run + Strides** Again, run an Easy 60 minutes at RPE4 pace
> with 8x20-second relaxed, mid-run sprints at RPE10 with 40 seconds of rest
> after each.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Kailash** Today your long ride reaches its peak duration and
> drives home the point that you can, in fact, go the distance. Because if you
> can ride for nearly 5 hours uninterrupted (a handful of 30-second backpedals
> don't count as interruptions, by the way), then you know you can keep your
> legs turning for upwards of 7 hours on the open road.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (4000m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE 4; 3200m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 400m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Your longest run peaks today at 2hr50min of Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6-pace running.
