# Trainer Road Plan: Gravity - Low Volume

> Mountain biking's Gravity disciplines - Downhill, Enduro, Slalom/Four-Cross -
> lean heavily toward the high-power end of the endurance performance spectrum,
> but endurance is still very much a part of the picture. Maximal power output
> along with high-end aerobic and anaerobic conditioning comprises the bulk of
> each version of the Gravity Specialty training plans. Each plan also addresses
> the endurance fitness necessary to ride competitively in any of mountain bike
> racing's Gravity disciplines.

## Week 1

> In order to get a handle on any improvement gleaned from recent Build training
> or anything along those lines, week 1 begins with a Ramp Test that will help
> us update your FTP and anchor your power levels for the training ahead.
> Ideally, you'll have a day or two of recovery in your legs and will feel ready
> to fairly demonstrate your current level of fitness. If not, consider riding
> easy today and postponing your assessment until tomorrow.  
> 
> Next, you'll face your first iteration of a theme present in every week of
> this training plan: reduced-recovery VO2max intervals. Each interval simulates
> race-day stress by forcing you to work well above your FTP long enough to load
> up your legs, then back off only as much as necessary to clear them before
> going again and again.
> 
> This first week closes with another recurring theme, that of the _hard start_.
> Each Threshold interval in this workout kicks off with a short but highly
> intense sprint to familiarize your legs and brain with the effort necessary to
> sprint off the line, surge past a competitor, or sprint up an incline. Then
> you will have to  stay on the gas for several minutes just below your
> threshold power and shift your focus to building stamina at a high percentage
> of your FTP.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

Rest Day

## Week 2

> With your assessment workout out of the way, it's time to breathe a bit more
> anaerobic/aerobic power into this plan using some short, intense intervals
> stacked so closely together that each subsequent repeat within a set grows
> increasingly aerobic in nature. High power? Check. Repeatability? Check.
> Higher performance capabilities? Check.
> 
> Then, both remaining workouts repeat last week's demands and offer the chance
> to improve on each workout's execution. Do your best to make each interval
> even higher in quality than last week and leave you feeling as though you
> couldn’t have done a better job.
> 
> A couple enhancements to expect are longer VO2max surges during your weekday
> repeats and some harsher sprint demands on the weekend. In both cases, the
> training load remains steady while the challenges within each workout grow
> noticeably.

## Week 3

> In terms of performance metrics, your Tuesday repeats look no different than
> last weeks - same duration, same TSS, same IF. But a seemingly minuscule
> reduction in the intrainterval recoveries will make an increasingly noticeable
> impact on each subsequent anaerobic repeat and force you to dig a little
> deeper earlier in each set.
> 
> Your second interval session of the week will raise the duration of every
> VO2max repeat to a consistently challenging length and draw out the workload
> as well as the benefit just a little further. While this makes for shorter
> sets, it makes each one a little more difficult as it opens your eyes to the
> effects a few extra seconds can have on _your_ muscles as well as those of
> your competitors.
> 
> Close out this third week with your most aggressive pre-Threshold-interval
> sprints yet. Find out if a 30-second effort at 1.5x your FTP comes as a
> detriment to your post-sprint power output or instead serves to open a more
> substantial gap on any rider in your wake.

## Week 4

> Time to let the last few weeks of training soak in over the course of an easy
> week of riding. During this week, try not to lose sight of the fact that
> **adaptation happens during recovery** , not during the often muscle-damaging
> doses of high-intensity training that comprised much of the last few weeks.
> 
> Until you firmly grasp the benefit of proper and adequate recovery, only hard
> lessons await you out on the trail. If, however, you've recognized the benefit
> of recovery done correctly, you'll happily abide by the low-intensity, same-
> training-schedule nature of this easy week.

## Week 5

> Following a bit of respite, it’s time to exploit your refreshed muscles and
> perspective by jumping right back into some potentially more entertaining
> workout formats beginning with a foray into highly-focused anaerobic work via
> repeats far less concerned with any aerobic benefit than growing your ability
> to produce short, very high-energy bursts of power. This intent is reflected
> in the short durations, the super high intensities, and the relatively
> generous recovery intervals.
> 
> With the goal of addressing aerobic and anaerobic capabilities within the
> confines of the same workout but also adding some less predictable variety
> into your hour of pain, the second workout of week 5 is a Coach Chad favorite
> that will throw a wide selection of efforts at you while keeping the
> recoveries as limited - yet sufficient - as possible.  
> 
> Finally, your fifth week closes with a bit of a mash-up where your hard-start
> efforts now precede your race-like on/ _not-quite-off_  repeats. Each one of
> these sets could very closely mimic the demands of the shortest of short track
> races, and having 6 in a row is likely to qualify as race-specific overload
> for most riders.

Rest Day

## Week 6

> Week 6 begins with a deceivingly difficult assortment of only a few very high-
> power repeats that target your ability to generate maximum wattage for a small
> variety of short-term, overlapping, full-gas durations. The intent here is to
> raise raw work capacity rather than cultivate repeatability.
> 
> Up next is another of Coach Chad's favorites that covers a lot of bases in a
> very narrow frame of time. Efforts ranging from max aerobic to low-end
> anaerobic with a heavy emphasis on repeatability and an apparent disdain for
> recovery will bury you in fatigue in a way only a mass-start race could rival.
> 
> Finally, another foray into the world of hard-start, low-recovery VO2max
> intervals awaits. This week the opening sprint ratchets another step. For some
> riders, this will just be the next step in the progression toward higher
> performance. For others, this might signify a breaking point. The key is to
> determine what sort of initial burst of power exacts too costly a toll on the
> remainder of the repeats and what leaves just enough fuel in the muscles to
> back up that hard charge.

## Week 7

> Week 7’s first round of intervals focus again on honing your ability to put
> down extremely high watts for very limited (but often pivotal) lengths of
> time. Whether you create big power with a fast spin, a big gear, or very
> likely a lot of each, this capability doesn't appear magically for most of us
> - it takes a few weeks of work dedicated to cultivating a very specific and
> useful form of fitness.  
> 
> Up next, a pretty fun foray into a varied but purposeful mix of VO2max and
> Anaerobic repeats that will continue to ice your high-performance cake. You'll
> undoubtedly hit upon duration/intensity combinations in which you excel as
> well as ones that really beat you up. Use this information to inform your race
> strategies as well as future training manipulations.
> 
> Finally, you'll close out your pre-taper training with one more round of
> Sprint + VO2max work that increases your initial sprint's intensity to its
> highest point. This assumes you haven't already exceeded this percentage of
> FTP in prior training having discovered a possible sprint aptitude. In any
> case, try for even higher watts this week knowing that any additional capacity
> derived from this final loading week is only going to serve you better on race
> day.

## Week 8

> It's time to taper your training load with the goal of leaving you fresh and
> motivated by the weekend. You'll begin with a shorter round of Anaerobic
> capacity repeats that maintain all of the intensity necessary to keep you
> sharp, but dispense a bit of the volume that leaves you heavily fatigued by
> the end of the workout.  
> 
> Your VO2max repeats see a volume reduction as well, but they too retain all of
> the intensity necessary to keep you familiar with the pain but light on
> fatigue.
> 
> Saturday is an  _openers_  workout based on a Sunday race, but if your race
> falls on Saturday or perhaps both weekend days, perform the short priming
> workout on Friday instead. If you'd prefer a different openers workout, take a
> look at Scott Peak or the many versions of Truuli.  
> 
> This week’s format can be repeated should you have a string of race weekends
> ahead since it maintains all of the necessary intensity but not nearly as much
> of the fatigue-inducing volume. Don’t plan to utilize this approach for more
> than a few weeks since peak fitness is a short-lived, temporary point in your
> ever-changing fitness.
> 
> Before that decline has any chance set in, go out there and reap the rewards
> of months of hard, consistent training the likes of which only the most
> dedicated and hard-working riders achieve.
