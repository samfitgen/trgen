# Trainer Road Plan: HIT Maintenance - Low Volume I

## Week 1

> The first week of any training plan is often dedicated to assessing your
> current fitness, and Week 1 of the HIT Maintenance plans is no exception. If,
> however, you feel that your current FTP estimate is reasonably accurate, you
> can substitute a weeknight club race or pluck a VO2 Max or Anaerobic workout
> from our Workout Library.
> 
> Should you choose to dive into a weeknight world championship, be bold and
> jump off the front for a solo TT that can offer some truer insight into your
> current sustainable power, i.e. FTP.
> 
> Following your assessment or substitution workout, you'll face a set of
> breakaway-like efforts that will challenge your high-end fitness in a number
> of ways.
> 
> Your week closes with several rounds of microbursts that again challenge your
> race fitness in multiple, simultaneous ways keeping the week's aim on target
> by honing your sharp, race-ready fitness.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> determine any Workout Intensity reductions that might be necessary.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 2

> Anaerobic and maximum aerobic power are this week's dual aim as you veer from
> one short but brutal format back to the other. You'll kick Week 2 off with
> some very short but very intense efforts way, way above your FTP before you
> tone things down just enough to repeat minute-long VO2 Max efforts with equal
> rest thereby shifting your focus more toward high-end, oxygen-driven power.
> 
> Finally, you'll close your week by blending your really high power numbers
> with minimal recovery periods to truly challenge your upper-end power
> capabilities.
> 
> Feel free to swap out any of this week's workouts for any weekday or weekend
> races you might have on your calendar.

> seconds at 140% FTP before stepping back down in reverse order.
> 
> Recoveries following each interval are 3 times as long as the interval itself
> (1:3 work to rest ratio) so recoveries are short but relatively sufficient.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 3

> In keeping somewhat with last week's supra-threshold onslaught, Week 3 begins
> with some straightforward VO2 Max repeats before introducing a new form of
> over-unders that more closely simulate the demands of working in a high-output
> paceline.
> 
> You'll cap off your week with a "fun" blend of VO2 Max work dosed with a
> number of muscle activation drills that will require your muscles to recruit
> every last available fiber.
> 
> As always, substitute a race for any of this week's 3 high-intensity workouts.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 4

> Time to dial things back and let your muscles heal and let your mind take a
> break from the stress of high-intensity workouts and races by skipping the
> whole race scene or at least trimming your racing endeavors to a single day
> and spending the rest of your time riding Tempo.
> 
> It's important to rein things in on a regular basis even though your top-notch
> fitness begs you to take full advantage of how strongly you might be riding.
> Learn to recognize that a bit of distance every so often can greatly increase
> your ability to stay sharp and motivated as the racing season continues.

Rest Day

## Week 5

> Time to jump back in with both feet and get Week 5 rolling with some VO2 Max
> repeats that allow you to determine if your repeatable maximum aerobic power
> is holding, growing or maybe even fading.
> 
> Then, it's time for another round of paceline repeats but this time the
> workload gradually escalates presenting an all-too-real simulation of what the
> closing minutes of a race can feel like.
> 
> Finally, you'll round out your week with a workout arguably harder than most
> of the races you might use as excuses to skip this beast. An unforgiving
> combination of racewinner intervals followed by 3 rounds of microbursts will
> make any rider long for a sub-hour criterium or the milder, steadier pace of a
> long road race.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 6

> Week 6 begins with a more straightforward interval workout, VO2 Max-style,
> before moving on to something more akin to a race simulation. This latter
> workout takes the shape of a 3x3x3 VO2 Max workout but does it in a manner
> that will leave you longing for steadier, more predictable periods of work. If
> you decide to race in place of this particular workout, you might consider
> rearranging your week to make sure you don't miss out on this gem.
> 
> The weekend concludes your sixth training week with easily one of
> TrainerRoad's most brutal interval formats - finishing efforts. Just when you
> think you can't work any harder, you'll be forced to do exactly that - again
> and again - recalling the type of brutality your bound to endure (or inflict)
> at some point over the course of your season.

> Then, 1 minute at 95% FTP is followed by a 30-second ramp to 105% FTP where
> you'll stay for 1 minute before surging to 130% FTP over the next 30 seconds.
> 
> The final kick includes 30 seconds at 130% FTP and a 30-second ramp to 150%
> FTP.
> 
> Each recovery ramp between intervals is 7 minutes.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 7

> If last week's early workout wasn't tough enough for you, the first workout of
> Week 7 is sure to have you on the ropes. In fact, if you can race instead
> tonightÉgo. While the efforts are short, the recoveries are too and this makes
> each subsequent Anaerobic repeat tougher than the one before it.
> 
> Should you make it through the early part of the week with your will to suffer
> still intact, Week 7's rounds of VO2 Max repeats are going to seem mild by
> comparison. But don't worry, they're still plenty productive and could even
> serve as the ego boost you need toward the end of a potentially humbling
> training plan.
> 
> Finally, your week draws to a close with another VO2 Max workout that offers
> an opportunity to further your aerobic power a bit but also grants the
> opportunity to get a status update on the repeatability of your high-end
> aerobic power.

**Description**:

> 3 sets of 3x3-minute VO2max repeats at 110-120% FTP with equal, 3-minute
> recoveries between intervals and 10-minute recoveries between sets of repeats.
> 
> Try to settle on a repeatable power output such that you finish each
> interval... barely. This might require some trial and error and it's likely to
> change as your fitness improves - you may be able to hold it for longer, you
> may be able to increase it, you may be able to repeat it with less rest.
> 
> Adjust the Workout Intensity as you see fit, but make each one of these mean
> something, make each one HURT!
> 
> And don't drop your watts lower than 110% FTP.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 8

> Time for your second opportunity to step back and recharge. Allow your body to
> mend, allow your mind to unclench and just ride your bike for a few days
> pushing the pedals with no real sense of urgency or training objective. If you
> simply have to get out there and squeeze in another race, try to limit your
> efforts to something short and fun.
