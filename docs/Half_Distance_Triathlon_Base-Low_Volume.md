# Trainer Road Plan: Half Distance Triathlon Base - Low Volume

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_   **FTP Assessment**  Get a solid estimate of your current fitness
> via the Ramp Test. You have the option of using the 8-minute FTP Test or the
> 20 Minute FTP Test if you prefer, just see to it that you reassess using the
> same workout each time.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (1400m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 8x25m CU
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 4x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; 8x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m
> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Run 35min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> randomly insert 6x30s bursts of high speed, RPE9 over the course of the run
> with at least 1 minute of recovery running between bursts.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Haku** Time to build some capacity! In particular, strength. By
> drilling it for a short 20 seconds at a time, your muscles will receive a
> loud-and-clear request for more - more muscle, more work, more power. This is
> true, on-the-bike strength work that will not only lift your ability to power
> the pedals for short durations but also much, much longer ones.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (1400m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 8x25m F
> drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 4x100m of 25m Easy, RPE4/25m Hard, RPE8,
> 10s rest between intervals; 8x25m SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-
> Down 300m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run** 35min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Walk briefly when
> necessary, no more than a minute though, if it means the difference between
> running well and sacrificing form while running efficiency suffers.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Antelope** 50 total minutes of endurance work comprise your
> weekend ride as you face fairly long intervals, spending as much time down
> low, in your aero position as you can tolerate. Fortunately, the recovery
> between each interval is pretty generous in the interest of keeping the
> steady, endurance-building watts comin’ for each of the 5 intervals. This is
> where your ability to ride at roughly this work level for multiple hours
> begins.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (1700m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 1200m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 50min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Again, walk briefly
> when necessary and try to recognize that quick walking breaks of a single
> minute can often keep the form high while costing very little in terms of
> aerobic fitness improvements.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> _Tuesday_ **Shasta** Abiding by the same strength-routine framework, try to

> them if necessary but keep your running as continuous as possible if you’re
> capable.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Brick Workout (Pioneer + 10min Transition Run)** Very much in
> line with the steady-state nature of a half distance triathlon’s bike leg,
> you’ll work steadily for 45 minutes on the bike, in your aero position as
> often as possible, before dismounting, transitioning quickly into your running
> gear and hoofing it at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6 for only 15 minutes of

> week 's 7 high-power repeats, add another this week and keep the power high

> separated by at least 1 minute of regular-pace running between bursts, but
> this week try to clean them up a little by running more fluidly, more relaxed,
> but just as fast.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Ericsson** Another round of pedal efficiency (or your ability to
> turn the pedals with the minimal amount of effort and energy) improvements.
> And as will often be the case, you 'll work in that narrow but highly
> productive power range. It will be close enough to your FTP to get your mind
> and body ready for the more rigorous workouts to follow in later training
> phases, but not too taxing that it prevents fairly rapid recovery.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed Intervals (1600m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4; 8x25m FS

> Down 300m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run** 40min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Shoot for those
> slightly longer stretches this week but keep your form at the top of your list
> of priorities. Much like swimming, small improvements in your technique can go
> a long way toward making you faster (and less prone to injury).
> 
> _Saturday_ **Galena** Taking the traditional 2x20 Sweet Spot workout a step
> further, this longer bike workout will challenge your endurance capabilities
> over the course of 3 long efforts all aimed at improving your mental and
> physical stamina. Do your best to spend time in your aero position and keep
> the pedals turning forward for each long set. But use 10-second backpedals -
> much the same way you occasionally use 1-minute walk breaks - if your form or
> cadence start to tank.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2000m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 1500m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 55min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Nearly an hour of
> running so fluidly and lightly that it 's hard to tell you're even working.
> Walk briefly when necessary and only if necessary.

> minutes at a time, over and over again. This week you’ll step things up only
> slightly by holding steadier watts well above FTP, all in the interest of
> expanding your ability to process more oxygen, pump more blood, and do both at

> 
> _Thursday_ **Spruce Knob** Treat each of these half-hour workouts as your one-
> and-only effort of the day and don’t get ahead of yourself. Make each one
> high-quality, mostly or entirely aero, and maybe even consider making those
> small fit changes you’ve been considering between intervals if you want a good

> that’s too steep for some reasonably fast running.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Big Squaw** Steady mileage at a highly aerobic work rate is once
> again the objective and steady hours of unrelenting, seemingly unending muscle
> stress, light though it may be, will slow-cook your endurance fibers and grow
