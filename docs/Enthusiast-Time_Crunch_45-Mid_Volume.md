# Trainer Road Plan: Time Crunch 45 - Mid Volume

> The Time Crunch 45 training plans still cater to time-limited training
> schedules but afford a little more stress and potentially a little more
> productivity. Again, riders on other plans can cherrypick shorter "30" or "45"
> -minute Time Crunch versions of their prescribed workouts when they find
> themselves a little short on time.
> 
> As can be expected, the warmups are short, the recoveries are brief and the
> cooldowns flash by pretty quickly. But the work intervals still retain the
> focus just like the longer versions of each Time Crunch workout. Then when you
> find yourself with a few extra minutes, your best bet is devoting that time to
> some extra warmup or you can simply tone down the intensity of the first
> interval/early few minutes when your time is limited to 45 minutes.
> 
> The mid-volume version of the Time Crunch 45 training plan puts you on the
> bike 5 times each week and separates your weekday workouts with a milder set
> of intervals during a 3-day stretch. If you find yourself coming into your
> weekend workouts too tired to hang, consider making your midweek workout even
> milder by adhering to the suggestions you'll find in each week's tips.
> 
> These plans lack scheduled recovery weeks and are not progressive in nature as
> their weekly training stress totals hover close to 300 TSS. The intensity of
> every workout is necessarily on the high side such that you can make the most
> of your limited training time, but there's no harm in toning down the Workout
> Intensity by 5-10% on those days where you're a little flat but still capable
> of some good quality effort.
> 
> With nearly 4 hours of high-quality work on the bike each week, these plans
> could potentially spur substantial improvements in your capabilities as long
> as you recognize those signs that tell you to back off a little by toning down
> or skipping the occasional workout and maybe even adding a recovery week
> should your motivation or performance plateau.

## Week 1

> Right out of the gates, the first workout of your first week drops you right
> into a round of unforgiving VO2 Max repeats with minimal recovery time. But
> who needs to breathe anyway?
> 
> If you're coming into this block with no recent estimate of your on-the-bike
> fitness, swap this workout for the Ramp Test. Or if you prefer, either the 8
> Minute FTP Test or the 20 Minute FTP Test will work, and they'll be the only
> hour-long workout of this entire training block.  
> 
> Following a mid-week form workout, you’re up against an even less forgiving
> interval format because your third workout of this first week will address
> muscle endurance and good ol’ fashioned strength as you ascend a few rounds of
> power steps.
> 
> Finally, you’ll start to close your first week with a coach-favorite, a few
> "sprint-erval" repeats where you’ll prep your muscles with some preliminary
> sprints before targeting muscle endurance by holding your threshold power plus
> a few extra watts, but who’s counting?
> 
> Then the icing on this week’s pain-cake takes the shape of 3 sets of Anaerobic
> capacity repeats to help develop or further your ability to lay down the high-
> power smackdown often & repeatedly.

## Week 2

> Week 2 kicks off with a mainstay of time-crunched training, high-intensity
> microbursts. These little marvels of misery alternate between all out & almost
> nothing while addressing more aspects of your fitness than you can imagine.
> 
> Following your midweek Sweet Spot workout, your third workout of Week 2
> consists of a slightly unusual take on over-unders but one that maintains the
> aim of improving your sustainable power by forcing you to work in close
> proximity to your FTP, whether slightly above or slightly below.
> 
> In order to further this week’s muscle trauma onslaught, the weekend first
> sees you tacking some truly high-intensity efforts but with substantially more
> recovery time between them (relatively speaking of course) in order to boost
> your short power & unload any headspace baggage you’ve accumulated over the
> week thus far.
> 
> And wrapping things up is easily one of TR’s cruelest time-crunched creations,
> ramping team time trial repeats. You’re gonna LOVE ‘em!

> eeease you into the world of oxygen deprivation with reasonably short 2-minute
> efforts.
> 
> This week closes first with a round of tried & true over-under intervals to
> remind you how subtle an increase in effort it takes to flood your muscles
> when you’re riding that fine line between "not hard enough" & "too hard". Oh,
> and they’ll improve your lactate tolerance too.
> 
> Then things finally wrap up with some maddeningly muscle fatiguing exercises
> in pain-patience that have you oh so gradually stepping toward & then away
> from total muscle failure, three times.

## Week 4

> Time for a recovery week! Well, not exactly, but you **are** encouraged to
> take one if you're feeling a little burnt out.  Otherwise, you’ll kick off
> this fourth week with a workout aptly named for both its dark nature as well
> as its highest of high intensities.
> 
> Get your weekly Sweet Spot work under your belt and then it’s onto 4 grisly
> total-body assaults which force you out of the saddle only to force you back
> into it for some increasingly demanding power output that only grows, all the
> way to the end.
> 
> And finally, your weekend’s double dose of high-intensity bliss finds us
> lovingly doting on your trashed muscles with an almost-friendly version of one
> of our most brutal formats, team time trial repeats. Let your team down and

## Week 5

> level of suffering by now.
> 
> Then you’ll take things "easy" during another Sweet Spot/form workout before
> it’s onto some straightforward Threshold work where you won’t even exceed your
> FTP…except when you do. Because every minute you’re goaded into a short but
> all-out sprint to not only keep you awake, but more importantly, to keep your
> muscles crackling with an unrelenting eagerness to go fast!
> 
> Cap the week off starting with some race-simulation efforts that ask you to
> attack and attack and attack (and rest occasionally) and you’ll be ready to
> tear the legs off any other rider training less than two and a half hours a
> week - we promise.
> 
> And the cherry on top of this week’s sundae of short-term suffering is a
