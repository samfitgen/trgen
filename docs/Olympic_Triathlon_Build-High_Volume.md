# Trainer Road Plan: Olympic Triathlon Build - High Volume

> These Build blocks place increasing importance on not only extending but
> sustaining your soon-to-be-elevated power & pace. Enduring some rather high-
> level discomfort is challenging but necessary in order to push you to this new
> level of performance.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max Intervals (2850m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 10x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 9x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 10x75m Hard, RPE9 w/ 45s rest between intervals;
> 10x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_ **20 Minute Test** With 6 weeks of base work in your legs, it's time
> to reassess your FTP in order to keep your workouts in line with your
> increasing fitness. Stick with the same workout format (8-Minute or 20-Minute)
> that you used the first time and count this as your first strength-endurance
> workout of your Tri Build training block.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2700m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 6x50m F
> &T; Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x200m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 10s rest
> between intervals; 5x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals;
> Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Hill Repeats** Spend 15 minutes working your pace up to an Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6 pace to warm, then perform 6x1-minute all-out uphill sprints on
> mildly steep, 4-6% grade, RPE 10 with 1min of recovery jogging back down to
> thebottomof the hill, RPE 2; cool down for 10 minutes at RPE 4 for 36 minutes
> of running.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Dade -1** Building on last week's 'diminishing' format, this
> round of VO2max repeats will hold you steadily at your highest aerobic output
> for the entire 2 minutes. Knock the intensity down a bit if you must, but by
> now you ought to be learning how to gut out these short, intense intervals
> without giving up any of their potential productivity.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Run 45min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> randomly insert 8x30s bursts of high speed, RPE9 over the course of your run
> with at least a minute's recovery between each fluid, high-speed effort.
> 
> _Friday_ **Pettit** Take it easy on the bike today while staying active but
> keeping recovery at the forefront of your mind.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Speed Intervals (2750m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 10x25m F drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 45s

> sprints; 10x25m K &R; drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
> RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Town Hill** The next step in your long-ride evolution tacks
> another 15 minutes onto what used to be your longest endurance ride. Spend
> long stretches of time in your aero position if your goal is to get downright
> comfortable in your low position.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Recovery Run + Strides** Run 40 minutes at an Easy, RPE 4 pace
> with the intent to accumulate additional aerobic mileage and maintain a high
> weekly run frequency. Insert 6x20-second relaxed sprints at RPE10 with 40
> seconds of rest between each.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2700m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE 4; 2000m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run 80min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 and try to keep your

### Monday 

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> Down 350m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Shortoff +1** The greatest benefit of VO2max works comes with
> longer durations at that high aerobic uptake. By adding a minute to each of
> these intervals, you actually gain more than a minute's benefit since this
> extra time is spent at an already highly elevated workload. But keeping things
> elevated means not taking any breaks, and if small reductions in intensity are
> necessary to keep you powering along, shave a few percentage points and keep
> those pedals turning.

> down for 10 minutes at RPE 4 for 35 minutes of running.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Red Lake +3** If working slightly below FTP strengthens the base
> for increases in FTP, working slightly above it serves to actualize those
> increases. Use these short but uncomfortable efforts to grow your boundaries,
> both physically and mentally - grow accustomed to the pain rather than trying
> to avoid it. If possible, spend some time in your aero posture, but on-Target
> power is still the top priority.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Recovery Run** Run 40 minutes at an Easy, RPE 4 pace with the
> occasional 1-minute walk-break as necessary during this recovery week run.
>

> Then, you'll dismount and transition quickly into your running gear right
> before you take off on a fairly short30-minute run at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6
> pace in order to get a feel for running off the bike as well as accumulating a
> bit of additional run mileage.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2300m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE 4; 1500m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 400m easy, RPE 4

> each, a new objective enters the mix: determining how hard you can work for 3
> minutes at a time and still repeat the effort productively. For some, 110% FTP
> is their max repeatable 3-minute power but for others, efforts all the way up
> at 130% FTP are possible. Find your breaking point, but don't surpass it -

> torture test, barely.

> 
> _Thursday_ **Red Lake +4** Same level of effort a little above FTP, same
> relatively generous recovery valleys, but a little more time at intensity this
> week, all aimed at increasing your ability to ride above your current
> capabilities. Again, ride aero if possible, but the greater concern here is
> your ability to sustain steady watts slightly above your FTP.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 10min working up to Easy-Moderate, RPE
> 6 pace to warm up, then repeat 16 Hard, RPE 9, 30-second high-speed surges,
> recovering for only 30 seconds after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down
> for a total of 36 minutes of running
>

> recovery mileage.

> rest between each.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2700m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE 4; 2000m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 400m easy, RPE 4
>

> 
> _Tuesday_ **Owens** Getting a little creative with your suffering this week,
> you'll face an assortment of efforts in the VO2max realm that not only vary
> the intensity but trim your usual 1:1 work-rest ratio down to a point where
> your recoveries are a little less generous and more aerobically demanding. All
> of this adds up to more time spent at a high aerobic uptake, less time spent
> drifting away from that high rate of respiration, and in time, greater
> improvements in sustainable power.

> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2900m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 6x50m F
> &T; Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x200m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 10s rest

> _Saturday_ **Allegheny** One more 15-minute addition to your long endurance
