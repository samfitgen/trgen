# Trainer Road Plan: Cyclocross - Low Volume

> The Cyclocross specialty plans will prepare you for the widely varied nature
> of 'cross racing by addressing the need for high-end sustainable power, the
> ability to generate high levels of force at very low cadences, and the
> development of repeated, high-power outputs following little if any recovery.  
> 
> Some cyclocross racers play things strategically, some exploit their technical
> finesse, and some capitalize on an outright willingness to suffer. But all of
> them rely on a high level of wide-ranging fitness which is exactly the aim of
> our Cyclocross plans.

## Week 1

> Beginning with your final scheduled FTP assessment, you'll first measure
> improvement garnered during your preceding Build plan in order to reestablish
> your power levels. With cyclocross being what it is, your Build plan may have
> been the Short Power, Sustained Power,  **or** the General Build training plan
> - such  as the variability in the demands of 'cross racing is.  
> 
> Post-assessment, you'll face what promises to be the first of many workouts
> aimed at peaking your ability to operate at a high level of your aerobic
> capacity. VO2max work is extremely beneficial, both in terms of its training
> adaptations as well as its similarity to the type of efforts required when
> racing on highly to mildly technical 'cross courses.
> 
> Week 1 closes with the first of your weekly race-simulation workouts. Composed
> of  _reduced-amplitude Billats_ , these little honeys will find you going
> full-gas or attempting to recover at a level of effort well above typical
> recovery power output. But again, such is the nature of cyclocross racing.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 2

> Week 2 sees the introduction of work dedicated solely to lifting your
> anaerobic power capabilities. This form of finishing work addresses your
> short-power capabilities by demanding possibly your highest indoor power
> outputs but only for short to very short durations. See these for what they
> are: short but painful bursts of power that cultivate raw strength and lift
> your overall work capacity.
> 
> Then you'll grow your VO2max interval duration by a slim but meaningful
> duration over last week's repeats. The goal here isn't to generate more watts
> but to hold the same high power numbers for slightly longer durations thereby
> lifting your capabilities to lay down and _sustain_ high power output.
> 
> You'll close out this second week of specialized conditioning with a different
> and mildly lighter round of race-simulating, high-power-recovery VO2max
> repeats. Use this as an opportunity to further familiarize yourself with the
> incessantly punishing nature of racing on the widest ranging terrain
> imaginable.

> each.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 3

> Week 3â€™s first round of intervals focuses again on honing your ability to put
> down extremely high watts for very limited (but often pivotal) lengths of
> time. Whether you create big power with a fast spin, a big gear, or very
> likely a bit of each, this capability doesn't appear magically for most of us;
> it takes a few weeks of work dedicated to cultivating a very specific and
> useful form of fitness.
> 
> Prior to your first and only recovery week, your VO2max durations hit their
> peak. While you may have done longer repeats in other training phases, it's
> likely that your peak-aerobic-uptake power has never been higher than it is
> right now. So yes, you'll again grow the ever-important duration, but you'll
> do it at your highest level of work  _quality_ to date.
> 
> Then, one last time, you'll face several varied-length bouts of race-specific
> repeats. This time, the recovery between each muscular assault has been
> minimized and will move you closer to the demands of mass-start racing on
> courses that funnel riders into fitness-contingent positioning. Put another
> way, only the strongest rise to the front of the field.

Rest Day

## Week 4

> Many low-volume athletes find they don't need an entire week of recovery-
> intensity riding in order to continue lifting their fitness. Some, however,
> need every single day of it. Base your recovery approach on earlier phases of
> training and how you felt during the latter half of your recovery weeks as
> well as how you felt directly following them.
> 
> In this plan's only week of dedicated downtime, consider a couple options.
> First off, you can follow the recovery protocol just as it's laid out if
> you've reached this fourth week in evident need of some R&R. Alternatively,
> you can adhere to just one or two of the three scheduled recovery workouts and
> then plan a harder, full-intensity workout on the weekend. Ideally, you'd
> compete in a cyclocross or even XC mountain bike race, but a repeat of any of
> the preceding weeks' Saturday workouts will suffice.
> 
> Finally, as you begin to feel rested and reasonably fresh, consider heading
> outdoors for one of these easier recovery rides. Ideally, find a grassy field
> where you can address your most lacking cyclocross skills.

Rest Day

## Week 5

> Following a bit of deloading that ideally finds you returning with a
> revitalized body and some renewed training motivation, itâ€™s time to get even
> more specific with your final few weeks of training. This begins by coupling
> two previous workout types into a single format by adding an anaerobic burst
> of power to the beginning of your race-simulating VO2max repeats.
> 
> Then, what were once straightforward aerobic capacity repeats morph into
> ostensibly anaerobic repeats. These short, intense intervals are so closely
> stacked that each subsequent repeat within a set grows increasingly aerobic in
> nature, making high demands on both major metabolic systems and reaping
> multiple training benefits. High power? Check. Repeatability? Check. Higher
> performance capabilities? Check.
> 
> Finally, your new end-of-week interval format couples high-power starts with a
> returned focus on fortifying your muscular endurance as you lead into your
> most important events. Practice pushing hard and then settling into a pace
> that will drop most fools who try to follow your moves, all while you
> strengthen your ability to hold high percentages of your FTP for increasing
> durations.

## Week 6

> Week 6 begins with a near repeat of last week's race interval combo, but with
> a slight increase in the intensity of your opening hard start. Do your best to
> follow this high-force push with a smoother set of VO2max repeats. Even though
> it's virtually the same workout as last week, you don't have to ride it the
> same way. Try to minimize any wasteful movement on the bike, any unnecessary
> muscle tension through your body, and any lack of control as each set
> progresses and your fatigue mounts.
> 
> In what might at first appear to be another repeat workout, this week's
> anaerobic-to-aerobic power repeats trim the recovery between intervals only
> slightly. While this is a seemingly minor change, the impact that it can have
> on a workout, a race, and (equally as important) your fitness can be nothing
> short of tremendous, especially as the repeats stack up.
> 
> Finally, your end-of-week combination workout kicks off with a familiar burst
> of power, only to grow your sustainable work duration afterward. The overall
> stress of the workout barely changes, but the demands of each interval rise
> substantially as your muscles are challenged with an additional chunk of
> unrelenting, sustained power output.

## Week 7

> Only a few subtle changes await you as you face one final week of loading
> rather than beginning a two-week race taper. When it comes to low-volume
> training, a two-week taper is often more than is necessary to bring out peak
> race-day fitness, so why not make the most of this final fitness-enhancing
> opportunity?
> 
> Accordingly, you'll see a very similar stress load to last week, with the
> addition of a couple shifts in each workout's race-specificity. This begins
> with another repeat of your Tuesday workout combination, but with one final
> bump in sprint intensity.
> 
> Then, your anaerobic/aerobic power repeats will get even cozier with one
> another; the intra-interval recoveries will shrink even more, making these
> efforts a little more aerobic a bit earlier in each set.

## Week 8

> During this final and repeatable (if necessary) peak-fitness week, the
> training load drops to its lowest, maintenance-only point in the interest of
> leaving you eager, rested, and excited to exploit your elevated fitness and
> high levels of performance confidence.
> 
> This weekâ€™s format can be repeated should you have a string of race weekends
> ahead since it maintains all of the necessary intensity but not nearly as much
> of the fatigue-inducing volume. You can also substitute a race simulation such
> as Blue, Barren, or Blood (or any of their variants) at the end of the week if
> it lacks a scheduled race.
> 
> The Saturday openers workout is meant to directly precede a Sunday race. If
> you're racing on Saturday, or perhaps both weekend days, move this workout to
> Friday or bypass it entirely if you perform well without a round of openers in
> your legs.
> 
> Finally, if you couple this final-week format with a weekly race or two, it's
> possible to maintain peak fitness for multiple weeks. Now, go out there and
> reap the rewards of months of hard, consistent training the likes of which
> only the most dedicated and hardworking riders achieve.
