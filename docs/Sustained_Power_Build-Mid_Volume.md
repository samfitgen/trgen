# Trainer Road Plan: Sustained Power Build - Mid Volume

> Coming off some consistent base training and adequate recovery following your
> last phase of training should find you eager to do the work necessary to lift
> your sustained-power capabilities. This plan will pursue that outcome from a
> number of different angles, all effective in terms of increasing your strength
> endurance, fatigue resistance and that ever-important mental ability to
> withstand long bouts of relentless discomfort.
> 
> Whether you're a road racer, a time trialist or multisport athlete, a marathon
> mountain biker or perhaps a century or gran fondo participant, pushing the
> pedals hard and doing it for a long time is a necessity.
> 
> It's for this very reason that the Sustained Power Build plans were developed
> -- to more specifically build your ability to push high, steady watts without
> fading over lengthy durations during multi-hour events.

## Week 1

> As you'd expect, Week 1 offers your first crack at assessing any improvements
> in fitness that your base training may have conveyed. While the Ramp Test is
> recommended, you're welcome to swap it with our 20 Minute FTP Test or 8 Minute
> FTP Test if you prefer that format.
> 
> You'll next face an unusually long midweek Endurance ride to make up for the
> lower-TSS assessment workout before moving on to a round of over-unders which
> will help you get an even better feel for where exactly you cross that lactic
> line.
> 
> Then, the week wraps up with what promises to be a common combination for the
> next few weeks. Your Saturday workout will challenge your ability to ride
> above your FTP for some fairly short but somehow long chunks of time before
> wrapping up with a stretch of Endurance work that spares you the necessity of
> a Friday TSS-filler.
> 
> Finally, some long stretches of Sweet Spot work will tone down the intensity
> but keep the focus on increasing your muscular stamina during your final
> workout of the week. And if you'd rather go the long/slow route today, ride
> Boarstone in place of Round Bald.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> Making the most of lower-volume indoor training requires a bit of the hard
> stuff; in particular, some VO2max work. So week 2 begins with your first taste
> of maximum aerobic power repeats followed immediately by 30 minutes of aerobic
> Endurance work that will both further your ability to use fat as fuel and also
> keep tomorrow's recovery ride short enough to actually constitute recovery.
> 
> Up next, a round of longer, muscle-burning over-unders present themselves as
> an opportunity to further nudge up that functional threshold power by
> expanding your ability to buffer that uncomfortable acidic excess while still
> working hard.
> 
> The weekend combo stays true to last week's intentions but grows the demands
> of both workouts, if only slightly in both cases. And just like last week,
> Boarstone is a good swap for Spruce Knob.

> between each.

## Week 3

> Week 3 starts with a VO2max workout strikingly similar to last week's but with
> a slight upward bump in intensity. This added workload is aimed at eliciting a
> higher level of oxygen uptake meaning you'll breathe a little harder, maybe
> recover a little more slowly, but heap a little more stress on your evolving
> aerobic system.
> 
> Following an easy aerobic spin, you'll move on to a set of longer, more
> demanding over-unders that will force to you manage the lactic flooding &
> clearing interplay for a quarter hour at a time while you build your ability
> to tolerate pain and resist fatigue.
> 
> And what a better way to close out this pre-recovery week than by asking you
> to take last week's brutal combo and make both workouts just a little bit more
> demanding, and productive.
> 
> Springer Mountain or Laurentian are good swaps for Tray Mountain if you'd
> prefer something longer and less intense.

## Week 5

> In the event your sustainable power has increased, we'll want to adjust your
> training zones appropriately, so Week 5 begins with a Ramp Test, an assessment
> workout you're welcome to switch for the 8 Minute FTP Test or the 20 Minute
> FTP Test based on whichever format helps you remain consistent over the course
> of your season.
> 
> Following a slightly extended aerobic Endurance ride, again to compensate for
> the lack of TSS during your assessment workout, we'll tone down your lactate
> tolerance workout and ride just above that point where your muscles flood and
> force you to sustain the burn and benefit from the discomfort in the process.
> These 8-minute repeats are separated by 4 minutes of recovery, but you're
> welcome to pause the workout and increase that by a minute or two if
> necessary.
> 
> The weekend brings with it a new combination of muscle-endurance workouts
> aimed at driving up your FTP some more. It starts with a round of over-unders
> where the format is flipped meaning you'll remain above threshold for 2
> minutes leaving only one minute to clear the heaviness before facing the
> sequence again and again.  
> 
> Finally, you'll back the intensity off somewhat and bank a lot of time riding
> in the Sweet Spot -- not excessively demanding, but nowhere near easy, and
> chalk full of potential stamina-enhancing goodness. And you're welcome to go
> the longer/slower route by substituting Town Hill in place of Juneau.

> 
> Following a midweek TSS-filler, you'll face some mercilessly longer lactate
> tolerance repeats. Much like last week, if the short recoveries aren't ones
> that will allow you to rally and survive the bulk of each interval, consider a
> short workout pause in order to continue to maximize the training benefit from
> these slightly supra-threshold work bouts.
> 
> Your weekend combo stays the strength-endurance course and only grows the
> demands of both workouts slightly. But it's enough to constitute progression
> and keep those high-end endurance capabilities on the rise. As usual, you can
> swap out Eclipse in favor of something like Big Mountain should you prefer
> more time in the saddle done at a lower intensity.

> lieu of any added aerobic Endurance riding.
> 
> Take a day to ride short and easy before you're pitted against a familiar
> round of slightly supra-threshold repeats where you'll complete one more
> interval than the last time you faced Stromlo. Based on previous weeks’
> experience, you may again to decide to lengthen the recovery valleys by
> tacking on some added recovery between intervals if you don't mind a little
> extra time on the bike.
> 
> Finally, your week finishes off with some slight but sure to be noticed
> increases in both the demands of your Saturday over-unders and your Sunday
> Sweet Spot repeats, both of which continue to strengthen your foundation for a
