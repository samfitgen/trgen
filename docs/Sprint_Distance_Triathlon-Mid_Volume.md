# Trainer Road Plan: Sprint Distance Triathlon - Mid Volume

> As athletes draw closer to their events, more specific conditioning becomes
> the focus of each subsequent training block. The increased focus on Threshold
> and VO2max work here make it abundantly clear that Sprint triathlons require
> speed in even measure with endurance.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Ramp Test** One final FTP assessment awaits since it's very likely
> you've seen improvement in your highest steady-state power over the course of
> your previous Build conditioning. Stick with your practiced and reliable
> assessment format - Ramp Test, 8 Minute or 20 Minute - and consider today your
> first strength-endurance workout of this new training block.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim VO2max + Sprint Intervals (2050m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 10x75m Hard, RPE9 w/ 60s
> rest between intervals; 7x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 6x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 10min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 to
> warm up, then repeat 5 Hard, RPE 9, 2-minute near-sprints, recovering running
> at RPE2 for 2 minutes after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down for a
> total of about 40 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Givens** As you adjust to VO2max efforts lasting 3 full minutes
> each, a new objective enters the mix: determining how hard you can work for 3
> minutes at a time and still repeat the effort productively. For some, 110% FTP
> is their max repeatable 3-minute power but for others, efforts all the way up
> at 130% FTP are possible. Find your breaking point, but don't surpass it -
> modify the Workout Intensity accordingly such that you complete each 3-minute
> torture test, barely.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Sprint Intervals (1850m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m F &T Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x150m Moderate-Hard, RPE8
> w/ 30s rest between intervals; 6x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest
> between sprints; 6x25m SK Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m
> easy, RPE4
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run + Strides** Run 15-20 minutes up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6
> to warm thoroughly, then perform 6x20-second relaxed sprints with 40 seconds
> of regular, RPE6 running in between them; finish the run with 25 Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6 minutes for about 55 minutes of running
> 
> _Saturday_ **Frissell +1** This weekend brings one more opportunity to
> practice repeating efforts slightly below your FTP in order to further your
> base of high-end endurance prior to the more specific endurance work you'll
> see over the next several weeks. Spend as much time as possible in your aero
> position as long as your power doesn't stray off the mark.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** Run 55 minutes Easy-Moderate, RPE 6
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2000m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE 4; 1,500m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE 4

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> _Tuesday_ **Kaiser** Only a small increase over last week's challenge comes in
> the form of a 'straight set' of 6 intervals but still matches last week's
> workload. These VO2max repeats are set consistently at 120% FTP, but that
> doesn't mean you can't drop the intensity if that's what it takes to make each
> of them successful (read: 100% completable).

> _Thursday_ **Red Lake** If working slightly below FTP strengthens the base for
> increases in FTP, working slightly above it serves to actualize those
> increases. Use these short but uncomfortable efforts to grow your boundaries,
> both physically and mentally - grow accustomed to the pain rather than trying
> to avoid it. If possible, spend some time in your aero posture, but on-Target
> power is still the top priority.

> effort grows a little more specific by pushing you above your FTP for much of
> the 30-minute effort sandwiched within this 45-minute bike workout. Then,
> you'll firm up your transition skills even further before taking off on
> another short10-minute transition run at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6 pace. Don't
> worry about running fast (yet), just try to run well with some heavy fatigue
> in your legs.

## Week 3

> _Tuesday_ **Owens** Getting a little creative with your suffering this week,
> you'll face an assortment of efforts in the VO2max realm that not only vary
> the intensity but trim your usual 1:1 work-rest ratio down to a point where
> your recoveries are a little less generous and more aerobically demanding. All
> of this adds up to more time spent at a high aerobic uptake, less time spent
> drifting away from that high rate of respiration, and in time, greater
> improvements in sustainable power.
>

> total of about 50 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Elephants -2  **Same level of effort as last week, same too-short
> recovery valleys too, but now you get another minute of pain added to each
> highly productive & highly challenging repeat. Again, you're welcome to ride
> aero, but not if it costs you power or steady watts.

> more with 25 Easy-Moderate, RPE6 minutes for about 55 minutes of running
> 
> _Saturday_ **Kaweah** Working this close to FTP is similar to a conservative
> race-day pace and it's also a productive power range in terms of lifting your
> sustainable power. Do your best to spend most, if not all, of your interval
> time down low only rising for a minute here  & there if your power starts to
> stray off-Target.

## Week 4

> _Tuesday_ **Gendarme** While totaling 20 minutes of VO2max work this week, it
> comes in the friendliest format we offer. By working for only 30 seconds at a
> time, the muscle pain never really rises to that almost unbearable level but
> still allows you to keep your breathing and HR somewhat lifted due to the
> equally short recovery valleys. Try to leave your intensity alone and see how
> the first several intervals go before you decide to tone things down.

> 
> _Thursday_ **Raymond** Time to dial the volume down a little bit, but we'll
> hang onto all of the intensity - wouldn't want you to lose touch with your
> ability to suffer. All told though, this workout should reduce the stress
> enough to make this feel closer to a recovery week than a build week. If
> that's not the case though, trim this workout in one of two ways: 1 - make the

**Description**:

> Sprint Triathlon Race if you have one scheduled.

## Week 5

> _Tuesday_ **Mills +1** Ideally, Owens gave you a better idea of your highest
> reputable 3-minute power. And since 2-minute repeats are substantially more
> tolerable, there's nothing keeping you from successfully completing every one
> of these shorter efforts at that 3-minute power.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim VO2max + Sprint Intervals (2050m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m FS Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x100m Hard, RPE9 w/ 60s
> rest between intervals; 8x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 6x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Tempo Run** Run 10min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE6 to warm up, then
> run steadily, Moderate-Hard, RPE8 for 20 minutes; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to
> cool down for a total of about 40 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Rubicon +2** As your highest priority event(s) draw closer, it's
> time to make things a little more race-specific by spending some time working
> at a realistic if optimistic level of effort. This pace may exceed your
> intended race pace, but the training is valuable nonetheless. Be aero if you
> plan to race at this pace, but sit up as much as you like if this is
> definitely faster than your goal power.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Sprint Intervals (2150m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy,
> RPE4; 8x25m BB Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8

> between sprints; 6x25m SK Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m
> easy, RPE4
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run + Strides** Run another 15-20 minutes up to Easy-Moderate,
> RPE 6 to warm, then perform 10x20-second relaxed sprints with 40 seconds of
> regular, RPE6 running in between them; again, finish the run with 25 Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6 minutes for about 55 minutes of running
> 
> _Saturday_ **Mount Goode** Back to that conservative race-day pace and some
> more time devoted to lifting your strength-endurance. Whether your FTP is
> still on the rise or you're simply getting more used to this level of effort,
> focus on really steady power delivery that belies the uncomfortably high
> workload.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run 65 minutes Easy-Moderate, RPE 6
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2300m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE 4; 1,500m

## Week 6

> _Tuesday_ **Matthes +1** Stepping things back into that 3-minute duration, the
