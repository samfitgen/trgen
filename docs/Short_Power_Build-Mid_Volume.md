# Trainer Road Plan: Short Power Build - Mid Volume

## Week 1

> As is typical of most of our training plans' first week, Week 1 offers your
> first crack at assessing any fitness improvements reaped from your former
> base-training efforts via our Ramp Test. And though this is our preferred FTP
> assessment protocol, you're welcome to substitute either the 8 Minute FTP Test
> or the 20 Minute FTP Test if that's your preferred assessment format.  
> 
> Following a midweek aerobic ride sprinkled with a few sprints, we'll throw you
> right into the deep end of the VO2max pool with some short but incessantly
> repetitious, high-intensity repeats to help acclimate you to the sensations
> (pain) that accompany your physically demanding riding style.
> 
> Finally, the weekend brings with it a recurring, useful blend of short,
> explosive efforts and some longer, mellower strength endurance work starting
> with what might be your first foray into traditional microbursts. By repeating
> short but powerful bursts of effort, you'll address your anaerobic as well as
> your aerobic capabilities thanks to the high number of microbursts as well as
> the ever so brief recovery valleys between them.
> 
> Then it's onto some straightforward Sweet Spot work where you're welcome to go
> the longer/slower route by substituting Town Hill in place of Antelope.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!


### Wednesday 

* **Name**: Collins +1
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 15 minutes
* **TSS**: 64.0

### Thursday 

* **Name**: Pierce
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 15 minutes
* **TSS**: 92.0
* **NP**: 172
* **IF**: 86%

**Description**:

> Pierce is six 4.5-minute sets of VO2max repeats where you'll ride for 15-25

### Saturday 

* **Name**: Spanish Needle
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes

### Sunday 

* **Name**: Antelope +5
* **Duration**: 2 hours
* **TSS**: 129.0
* **NP**: 160
* **IF**: 80%

**Description**:

> Antelope +5 is 7x10-minute Sweet Spot intervals ranging between 88-94% FTP
> with 5-minute recoveries between intervals.

## Week 2

> Week 2 is your first front-loaded week where you'll face a slightly longer
> workout early in the week largely due to the extended segment of aerobic
> Endurance riding tacked on to the end of the workout that helps keep
> tomorrow's short and easy ride actually pretty short and easy. Closely stacked
> VO2max repeats aim to challenge both your ability to perform seemingly
> anaerobic efforts at high wattage, but just as importantly, they'll task your
> aerobic engine more and more as the closely-set intervals progress.
> 
> Following the previously mentioned Endurance ride, this one also including a
> small handful of short sprints, your second interval workout of the week is a
> slight extension of the workout you did last week with just an extra 30
> seconds of work added to each interval.
> 
> Your weekend begins with a workout which addresses your ability to accelerate
> powerfully before settling into some strength endurance work, several times
> over, before capping each set with one final kick thereby addressing all of
> the energy systems necessary during a race-winning move.
> 
> Your weekend ends with another Sweet Spot workout totaling only slightly more
> work than last week's, and again one you can skip in favor of Town Hill should
> you prefer more time in the saddle done at a lower intensity.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Baird +6
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 110.0
* **NP**: 172
* **IF**: 86%

**Description**:

> Baird +6 is 3 sets of 5x90-second intervals at 120% FTP followed by 30 minutes
> at 65% FTP.
> 
> Recoveries between intervals are 1 minute long and recoveries between sets of
> intervals are 5 minutes long.


### Wednesday 

* **Name**: Pettit +1
* **Duration**: 1 hour
* **TSS**: 43.0
* **NP**: 132
* **IF**: 66%

**Description**:

> Pettit is an hour of Aerobic Endurance spent mostly between 60-70% FTP and
> includes Form Sprints, Endurance Spinning intervals, and Pistons/Kick and Pull
> pedaling drills.
> 
> Form Sprints: Practice high-rpm sprint simulations at low power outputs to
> reinforce proper sprinting technique by jumping out-of-the-saddle and winding
> up a light gear. As your cadence reaches its controllable peak, gracefully
> transition into the saddle where you can shift gears if necessary. These
> sprints are only 10s long and are all about leg speed, form, and technique.
> Experiment with which foot to lead with, and learn how to generate a lot of
> leg speed in very little time.
> 
> Endurance Spinning: Practice spinning slightly quicker than your natural,
> self-selected cadence. Ride at a cadence that's at the very top of your
> comfortable rpm range and remain there for a solid 5 minutes. The goal is to
> learn to turn the pedals more quickly with less force (muscle stress) thereby
> improving your ability to remain predominantly aerobic over a wide range of
> rpm's. If your HR rises more than a few BPM, you're pedaling too quickly -
> take it easy and stay relaxed but quick.
> 
> Pistons: Few if any riders need to practice pushing down on the pedals, but
> improvements in how well your knees move are both beneficial to economy and
> joint health. As you pedal, pay close attention to how your knees track. They
> should move directly up, directly down - like pistons - with little if any
> lateral movement, especially at the top of each pedalstroke. Focus on one knee
> for 30s before switching sides.
> 
> Kick and Pull: A balanced pedalstroke is dependent upon consistent tension on
> your bike's drivetrain throughout the entire pedalstroke. Reinforce your
> ability to maintain tension through the weakest portions of the pedalstroke,
> the top and bottom quadrants. As your knee approaches top-dead-center, lightly
> kick your toes into the fronts of your shoes, and as your feet approach
> bottom-dead-center, lightly pull your heels into the backs of your shoes -
> kick and pull. Focus on just the kick for 30s, just the pull for 30s, then
> eventually both for 30s simultaneously.
> 
> Modifications: 2 late-ride sprints


### Thursday

### Saturday 

* **Name**: Lion Rock
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 103.0
* **NP**: 166
* **IF**: 83%

**Description**:

> Lion Rock is 3 sets of 3x5-minute Threshold efforts that begin with a
> 15-second sprint at 150% FTP and then settle in for 4 minutes at 95% FTP, aka
> "racewinners".
> 
> Each set finishes with a 30-second "kick to the line" in the form of a ramp
> from 95% FTP all the way up to 140% FTP.
> 
> Recoveries between intervals are only 1 minute long but recoveries between
> sets of intervals are each 10 minutes long.


### Sunday

**Description**:

> Juneau -1 is 4x18-minute intervals at 88-92% FTP with brief, 1-minute
> intermediate recoveries during each long interval.
> 
> 7-minute recoveries fall between intervals.

## Week 3

> This week's first slightly extended workout is a close cousin to the one you
> faced last week. The only difference is the repeats are done at a slightly
> higher output with the intention of increasing the potency of your repeatable,
> high-power efforts.
> 
> Then it's on to another short, relatively easy Endurance ride again containing
> a small handful of muscle-fiber-awakening sprints before you face the next
> progression in the high-valley VO2max repeats series. These demanding valleys
> between surges are aimed at keeping your heart rate and breathing elevated
> such that each set of intervals taxes your aerobic engine as hard as multi-
> minute VO2max repeats, just in a more engaging, race-like manner.
> 
> And then the weekend first sees a couple rounds of now familiar racewinners
> followed by another dose of microbursts. Roadies who learn to perform these
> tasks back-to-back will foster an ability to make their way into a break and
> then contest the inevitable infighting, while trail riders can further their
> ability to conquer wildly rolling courses or trails.
> 
> Close your week with another increase in the amount of Sweet Spot crammed into
> the same 2 hours, or opt for another slower go at Town Hill before heading
> into your first recovery week.

## Week 5

> It's highly likely your fitness has improved over the course of the first 4
> weeks of your Build conditioning. So you'll want to adjust your training zones
> accordingly and keep the challenges appropriately...challenging. As such, Week
> 5 begins with another Ramp Test, an assessment workout you're welcome to swap
> for the 8 Minute FTP Test of the 20 Minute FTP Test if you prefer.
> 
> After a temporarily longer midweek Endurance + Sprints workout, it's on to
> your next VO2max progression where those comparatively short repeats become
> fewer in number but substantially longer in duration. But the intent remains
> the same: increasing the duration at your repeatable maximum aerobic power.
> 
> You'll finish out this week starting with a round of efforts that mesh the
> demands of the high-valley VO2max repeats with those of the hard starts that
> kick off racewinners. Then, it's on to a longer, mish-mash ride where efforts
> range from short, all-out sprints to low-end Tempo repeats and everything in
> between. If you choose to do something longer and slower instead, consider
> Flattop since it includes a couple of early-workout sprints.

## Week 6

> Week 6 kicks off with some highly anaerobic repeats that again, grow
> increasingly aerobic due to the minimal downtime between repeats within each
> high-power set. Anaerobic power combined with strong aerobic capabilities are
> your bread & butter as a short-power cyclist.
> 
> Following your midweek 'enhanced' Endurance ride, you'll see a slight
> escalation in the duration of your VO2max intervals with the addition of
> another 30 seconds but a slight decrease in power output will help compensate.
> If you feel like you can handle the additional 30 seconds at last week's 120%
> FTP, you're encouraged to step up the intensity even if you sensibly wait
> until the second or third set.
> 
> Then your weekend starts with some longer Threshold efforts that each kick off
> with a single, all-out kick to get things rolling. Do your best to gut out
> these considerably challenging intervals as they stand, but don't hesitate to
> drop the intensity a little if that's what it takes to repeat several of these
> efforts.
> 
> Finally, it's on to a mildly scaled up version of last week's group-ride
> workout, and you're welcome to go longer and slower by replacing it with Big
> Mountain. Don't forget to add a couple early-workout sprints in the interest

## Week 7

> Your final pre-recovery week starts with some descending anaerobic intervals.
> As the intensity rises, the durations of each interval fall in order to keep

> Then as usual, it's on to your midweek Endurance ride, this time with a couple
> late-workout sprints tacked on.
> 
> Then exactly like the suggestion made last week, this week's VO2max offering
> keeps the durations at 3 minutes and combines the slightly higher power of
> week 5's round of aerobic capacity repeats. So if you heeded that advice and
> made it work for you, consider another small jump in intensity during any
> number of this week's sets.
> 
> The weekend starts with a repeat of the format faced in Week 5 where you'll
> mash hard-start watts directly into follow-up rounds of high-valley VO2max
> repeats as you square off against a very race-like cluster of intervals.
> 
> One more slight bump in group-ride TSS and you'll wrap up the second loading
> cycling in this Short Power Build plan. Again, feel free to ride longer and at
> lower intensity by using something like Big Mountain or Allegheny, or perhaps
> get outside and spend a few hours enjoying the outside world, maybe even throw
> in a few short, hard sprints.

## Week 8

> Having made it through 7 grueling weeks of Short Power Build training, it's
> again time to rest up with a repeat of Week 4's recovery cycle.
> 
> By repeating your recovery weeks in nearly identical fashion, you're provided
> with an opportunity to modify your recovery workloads to fit your particular
> recovery profile. Did your last recovery week leave you feeling a bit too
> tired to dive back into training? Perhaps you didn't need quite as much rest
> as you were given.
> 
> In any case, similar recovery weeks provide a consistent protocol that can be
> altered as necessary such that you feel eager and rested heading into your
> next round of training without feeling like you backed off too far.
