# Trainer Road Plan: Short Power Build - Low Volume

> Building on the hard-earned base conditioning you've recently established,
> it's time to move toward increasingly specific forms of training stress in
> order to better prepare you for your specific events as well as the even more
> event-specific training to follow.
> 
> Even a short-power rider maintains a heavy reliance on longer, sustained
> power. Accordingly, a toned-down emphasis on strength endurance will still
> find its way into this Short Power Build plan but greater attention will fall
> on improving your ability to operate at high percentages of your VO2max power
> as well as your ability to throw down big watts for very short durations,
> repeatedly, and often with minimal recovery time.  
> 
> So riders concentrating on improving their abilities as shorter-course
> mountain bikers, cyclocross racers, criterium specialists as well as those
> taking part in weekday world championships will find this Build plan a proper
> match for their dynamic riding style. This training will further your ability
> to race aggressively, react quickly and powerfully, and do so again and again
> with minimal or no decline in performance.

## Week 1

> As is typical of most of our training plans' first week, Week 1 offers your
> first crack at assessing any fitness improvements reaped from your former
> base-training efforts via our Ramp Test. And though this is our preferred FTP
> assessment protocol, you're welcome to substitute either the 8 Minute FTP Test
> or the 20 Minute FTP Test if that's your preferred assessment format.
> 
> Then, we'll throw you right into the deep end of the VO2max pool with some
> short but incessantly repetitious, high-intensity repeats to help acclimate
> you to the sensations (pain) that accompany your physically demanding riding
> style.
> 
> Finally, the weekend brings with it this plan's first combination workout
> which addresses your ability to accelerate powerfully before settling into
> some strength endurance work, several times over, before capping each set with
> one final kick thereby addressing all of the energy systems necessary during a
> race-winning move.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

* **Name**: Lion Rock
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 103.0
* **NP**: 166
* **IF**: 83%

**Description**:

> Lion Rock is 3 sets of 3x5-minute Threshold efforts that begin with a
> 15-second sprint at 150% FTP and then settle in for 4 minutes at 95% FTP, aka
> "racewinners".
> 
> Each set finishes with a 30-second "kick to the line" in the form of a ramp
> from 95% FTP all the way up to 140% FTP.
> 
> Recoveries between intervals are only 1 minute long but recoveries between
> sets of intervals are each 10 minutes long.


### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 2

> Week 2 is your first front-loaded week where you'll face a slightly longer
> workout early in the week mostly due to the longer recovery durations between
> sets of intervals. And you'll need it because these ones in particular will
> challenge both your ability to dole out big watts, but just as importantly,
> they'll task your aerobic engine more and more as the closely-set intervals
> progress.
> 
> Your second, shorter workout of the week is likely to seem easy by comparison
> since it's not only shorter but also less intense. But don't be fooled because
> it will still test your aerobic capabilities while building a bit of staying
> power by requiring you to repeatedly sustain high percentages of your VO2max
> power.
> 
> Finally, your week closes with something akin to racewinners where the
> emphasis shifts away from the explosive efforts and more toward the sustained
> ones. After all, what's a good jump without the ability to back it up?

Rest Day

## Week 3

> This week's first slightly extended workout is a close cousin to one you faced
> during week 1. So with a bit of experience in hand, do your best to make the
> most of each round of high-valley VO2max repeats with fluidity between power
> surges. These demanding valleys between surges are aimed at keeping your heart
> rate and breathing elevated such that each set of intervals taxes your aerobic
> engine as hard as multi-minute VO2max repeats, just in a more engaging, race-
> like manner.
> 
> Workout #2 slightly grows the demands of last week's with a mild bump in the
> power requirement in the interest of growing your repeatable power output.
> 
> And then the week closes with some familiar racewinners followed by what could
> well be your first exposure to traditional microbursts. Roadies who learn to
> perform these tasks back-to-back will foster an ability to make their way into
> a break and then contest the inevitable infighting, while trail riders can
> further their ability to conquer wildly rolling courses or trails.

## Week 5

> It's highly likely your fitness has improved over the course of the first 4
> weeks of your Build conditioning. So you'll want to adjust your training zones
> accordingly and keep the challenges appropriately...challenging. As such, Week
> 5 begins with another Ramp Test, an assessment workout you're welcome to swap
> for the 8 Minute FTP Test of the 20 Minute FTP Test if you prefer.
> 
> Then it's on to your next VO2max progression where those comparatively short
> repeats become fewer in number but substantially longer in duration. But the
> intent remains the same: increasing the duration at your repeatable maximum
> aerobic power.
> 
> You'll finish out this week with a fun if painful combination of sprints and
> suprathreshold repeats bent on furthering both your ability to ride
> explosively as well as sustain power well above your FTP.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 6

> Week 6 rearranges the front-loaded format you saw in the first few weeks of
> training due to the higher intensity of each week's opening workout. Ideally,
> this will help you get through the hardest workouts when you're freshest and
> keep each workout as productive as possible, starting with some descending
> anaerobic intervals. As the intensity rises, the durations fall in order to
> keep pushing your muscular capabilities without overly taxing them
> metabolically.
> 
> Then, you'll see a slight escalation in the duration of your VO2max intervals
> with the addition of another 30 seconds but a slight decrease in power output
> will help compensate. If you feel like you can handle the additional 30
> seconds at last week's 120% FTP, you're encouraged to step up the intensity
> even if you sensibly wait until the second or third set.
> 
> Finally, you'll revisit a familiar interval format: hard starts + muscle
> endurance work. In this case though, the endurance work comes up from Sweet
> Spot intensity and asks you to ride substantially closer to your FTP. Do your
> best to gut out these considerably more challenging intervals as they stand,
> but don't hesitate to drop the intensity a little if that's what it takes to
> repeat several of these efforts.

## Week 7

> Week 7 kicks off with some highly anaerobic repeats that again, grow
> increasingly aerobic due to the minimal downtime between repeats within each
> high-power set. Anaerobic power combined with strong aerobic capabilities are
> your bread & butter as a short-power cyclist.
> 
> Exactly like the suggestion made last week, this week's VO2max offering keeps
> the durations at 3 minutes and combines the slightly higher power of week 5's
> round of aerobic capacity repeats. So if you heeded that advice and made it
> work for you, consider another small jump in intensity during any number of
> this week's sets.  
> 
> Finally, you'll wrap up your final Short Power loading week with Thor's
> bigger, tougher brother Tom. In this version in particular, you'll repeat
> several rounds of more intense sprints and follow them with slightly more
> demanding suprathreshold segments. It's all part of the adaptive process that
> requires each week to be a little tougher than the last in order to make you a
> little faster than you were before.

## Week 8

> Having made it through 7 grueling weeks of Short Power Build training, it's
> again time to rest up with a repeat of Week 4's recovery cycle.
> 
> By repeating your recovery weeks in nearly identical fashion, you're provided
> with an opportunity to modify your recovery workloads to fit your particular
> recovery profile. Did your last recovery week leave you feeling a bit too
> tired to dive back into training? Perhaps you didn't need quite as much rest
> as you were given.
> 
> In any case, similar recovery weeks provide a consistent protocol that can be
> altered as necessary such that you feel eager and rested heading into your
> next round of training without feeling like you backed off too far.
