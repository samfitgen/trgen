# Trainer Road Plan: Century - High Volume

> The high-volume version of the Century specialty block consists of 6 rides
> each week which primarily address strength endurance but do so in a few
> different ways.  Long distance, steady-state riding relies largely on this
> ability to work at a high, steady percentage of FTP so the clear emphasis of
> this Specialty plan falls on strength endurance.
> 
> This peak-fitness block uses a consistently progressed but interestingly
> varied approach to increase your ability to turn the pedals hard for long
> durations including some late-plan, high-intensity VO2max work - all in the
> hopes of maximizing a comparatively small amount of weekly riding and yielding
> big-training-budget rewards on a still fairly low-time-budget schedule, even
> in this relatively high-volume plan.  
> 
> By dedicating no more than 9 hours per week, you can see sizable gains that
> will lead to faster completion times, less discomfort in the saddle over these
> long hauls, and greater performance confidence tied to the improved fitness
> derived from this concentrated and specific ultra-distance conditioning block.

## Week 1

> Whether you just wrapped up a Sustained Power Build block or you're reaching
> this plan from a different avenue, getting a measure of your current fitness
> is the first order of business. Use the Ramp Test (or the 20 Minute FTP Test
> or 8 Minute FTP Test if that's your preference) to get an estimate of your
> sustainable power and help us anchor your training levels.  
> 
> Following an easy, midweek aerobic spin, one that’s longer than usual in order
> to make up for the relatively low TSS accumulated during your assessment
> workout, you'll have the opportunity to see if your estimated FTP is close to
> the mark as you undulate above and below your lactic tipping point over the
> course of a familiar round of over-unders.
> 
> After another short, low-intensity Endurance ride, your weekend begins with
> some concentrated Threshold work that will keep you close to your lactic limit
> for increasing durations beginning with this round of 10-minute jobbers, all
> in the interest of lifting your ability to endure fairly high watts.
> 
> The week then finishes off with a healthy dose of Sweet Spot work aimed at
> furthering your ability to hold high percentages of your newly improved
> functional threshold power. But if you'd rather go longer and easier, skip
> this version of Antelope in favor of Town Hill or Maclure.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> Week 2 begins with a reintroduction to 105's - efforts done far enough above
> your FTP to inspire increases in it but repeats done far enough below your
> VO2max ceiling to allow durations substantially longer than most aerobic
> capacity repeats. The addition of some post-interval aerobic work is aimed at
> keeping tomorrow’s short, easy ride actually short and easy, but it also
> serves to maintain and even improve your butter-burning capabilities.
> 
> After those two rides, you’ll endure another round of over-unders where your
> over-segments guide you toward managing muscle burn for twice the usual
> duration.
> 
> Then it’s onto another short, easy aerobic spin before your second weekend
> kicks off with some slightly longer Threshold repeats but the same total work
> duration as last week since the focus is more on extending your time at
> intensity than increasing intensity. Get used to working this close to your
> FTP, then any work spent farther below your threshold power will become more
> and more manageable and inflict far less muscle fatigue.
> 
> And your week again wraps up with some endurance-extending Sweet Spot work
> done fewer times but for substantially longer durations adding up to a little
> more time in the Sweet Spot than last week. Your longer/lower alternatives are
> the same as last week: Town Hill or Maclure.

## Week 3

> One more week of increasing demands separates you from a week of easy riding,
> and it starts with only a small escalation in the total duration of your
> 105's. They're a little shorter, but they're greater in number in hopes of
> further lifting your ability to sustain power above your FTP.
> 
> Follow up those intervals with some additional aerobic base reinforcement, and
> then noodle through an hour of aerobic endurance work followed the next day by
> your final dose of over-unders sees your total near-FTP time rise by a few
> more minutes.
> 
> But the fun doesn't stop there! Saturday pits you up against a slightly more
> challenging round of strength-endurance-enhancing Threshold repeats where the
> intervals grow fewer in number but longer in duration than last weekend’s.
> 
> Finally, Sunday brings on some downright intimidatingly long intervals in a
> good news/bad news scenario: only 4 intervals/they're each 20 minutes long.
> But by now you've employed a backpedal break or two (or you're a true machine)
> and have recognized them for the carrots they are. Use those carrots to keep
> you chugging along with sometimes just the promise of a short bail-out, but
> don't hesitate to include a couple of actual no-load breaks to keep you
> motivated and productive.
> 
> Your lower intensity options this week are Mount Cook or Tenaya.

## Week 5

> In the event your sustainable power has increased, we'll want to adjust your
> training levels appropriately. So Week 5 begins with a Ramp Test or the
> optional 8 Minute FTP Test or 20 Minute Test based on whichever format helps
> you remain consistent over the course of your season.
> 
> Up next is your usual, midweek spin where you’re welcome to dial down the
> intensity or even cut it a little short anytime you feel the lingering effects
> of the prior weekend’s work a little too strongly.
> 
> Then, in the event you thought you were done with VO2max work, your second
> workout kicks off a late-plan round of aerobic capacity work to help nudge up
> your sustainable power capabilities a little more prior to your most important
> event(s). By stressing your heart, lungs, and muscles briefly but intensely,
> you can find a little more room to allow your FTP to rise.
> 
> After a short, aerobic Friday spin, your first weekend workout continues to
> escalate your total Threshold duration in order to further challenge your
> rising ability to endure near-FTP watts.
> 
> The first week in this second round of loading concludes some lower-end Sweet
> Spot work that is a bit more in line with the type of effort you may find
> yourself exerting over the course of your 100-mile events. And while you may
> seldom work this hard during your multi-hour endeavors, the muscle endurance
> cultivated here will only make your day more enjoyable and probably a bit
> faster.
> 
> Your lower/longer alternatives this weekend are once again Town Hill, Maclure
> or an equal-TSS outdoor ride.

## Week 6

> Week 6 starts by dialing down your 105's to 102's, but what's lost in
> intensity will be accounted for in either less recovery or greater interval
> duration. Regardless, the focus now is less on lifting your FTP as much as
> gradually lowering bodily fatigue over the course of these final weeks of
> training.
> 
> Following your midweek aerobic Endurance ride, you’ll trim down your VO2max
> repeats by 30 seconds each, but you’ll find a couple extra in there to more
> than make up the difference - our gift to you. Retaining this single high-
> intensity workout each week remains in the spirit of extracting some last-
> minute-fitness gains, but modify the workout intensity as necessary in order
> to fully but barely complete these relatively long high-capacity repeats.
> 
> Spin _through_ your fatigue on Friday and help your muscles clear off and
> replenish prior to your Saturday workout which is once again about pushing you
> right up to the lower edge of your sustainable capabilities but for slightly
> longer durations than last week, slightly longer total duration too.
> 
> Then cap off the week with a sizable drop in your Sweet Spot interval
> durations but an extra interval to again more than make up for the loss. The
> goal, of course, is to put your ever-rising strength endurance to the test
> over some long but manageable efforts. Alternatively, consider Ptarmigan +1 or
> Big Mountain unless you’re heading outdoors to accumulate your lower-intensity
> stress.

## Week 7

> Only one week of hard work left, then it's onto a pre-event recovery week. To

> little bit, but will fortify your ability to dole out high, steady wattage
> regardless.
> 
> Noodle through this week’s easy ride, then up next is one last round of VO2max
> repeats that return to that impossibly long 4-minute duration. Pushing your
> breathing and heart rate to a very high level and then keeping it there is the
> essence of VO2max work. The longer you stay there, the greater the training
> stimulus and the higher your post-recovery capabilities.
> 
> Cruise through just one more Friday Endurance ride and then your first weekend
> challenge comes in the form of your longest Threshold efforts to date, and
> they’re spaced so closely that you’ll effectively perform an hour-long time
> trial in order to deal your system on last heavy dose of muscle stress.
> 
> And then, it all wraps up with final Sweet Spot workout with some slightly
> friendly 30-minute blocks including a short, but potentially lifesaving, mid-
> interval recoveries. **Another** gift from us!  
> 
> Again, the capability to ride at percentages this high for durations this long
> will have a resounding effect on all power levels below it. So as you work
> through this last round of Sweet Spot work, do so knowing that the longer you
> hang in there, the easier everything else will become by comparison.
> 
> And some lower-intensity alternatives this week are Mount Cook, Tenaya or an
> outdoor TSS-equivalent.

> like to be for a Sunday century or how smashed you are from a Saturday
> 100-miler.
> 
> And if you're lively with energy, feel free to add a bit of intensity into
> either or both of Tuesday’s and Thursday’s workouts with the addition of a
> couple of short, Sweet Spot efforts folded into the low-intensity riding
> that's prescribed. Something along the lines of a couple of 3- to 5-minute
> efforts at 85% FTP should suffice.
>
