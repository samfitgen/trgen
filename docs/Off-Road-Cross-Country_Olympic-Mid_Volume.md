# Trainer Road Plan: Cross-Country Olympic - Mid Volume

> The Cross-Country Olympic MTB plans will prepare you for the widely varied and
> typically high-intensity nature of XC racing by combining a focus on short,
> highly repeatable bursts of power coupled with efforts bent on driving up the
> watts and keeping them high for extended lengths of time.
> 
> As the nature of off-road racing is often unpredictable with terrain that can
> veer from wide open fire road to technical, rocky singletrack--all on subtle
> to severe grades--cultivating a well-rounded rider with a wide-ranging set of
> capabilities is the goal of each version of this plan.

## Week 1

> Week 1 gets you rolling with an ever-present FTP assessment to account for any
> recent improvements in your sustainable power via our Ramp Test. You're
> welcome to use either the 20 Minute FTP Test or the 8 Minute FTP Test if
> that's your preference. In any case, try to have a day or two of recovery in
> your legs and feel ready to fairly demonstrate your current level of fitness.
> If not, consider riding easy today and postponing your assessment until
> tomorrow.  
> 
> Your midweek Endurance ride includes a couple of late-ride sprints to begin
> sharpening your more explosive power. Then it's onto a few rounds of short-
> duration/short-recovery repeats in anaerobic territory. As these short, sweet
> & densely packed repeats stack up, your aerobic engine will become
> increasingly involved thus taxing your muscles in multiple, effective ways.
> 
> The weekend begins with a workout that aims to keep its format as close to
> that of an aggressive XC race as possible. With short, punchy VO2max efforts
> spaced across several rounds of Sweet Spot intervals, this type of work
> targets numerous race-day demands as it too grows your aerobic and anaerobic
> fitness simultaneously.  
> 
> Finally, a round of hard-start Sweet Spot efforts will accomplish a couple
> goals. First, you'll target your ability to generate  _real big_  watts. And
> second, you'll tackle some muscle endurance work up toward the high end of
> your current sustainable capabilities.
> 
> Alternatively, you can swap your Sunday ride for some similar TSS trail time,
> preferably on mild, sustained climbs and sprinkled with a couple sprints, or
> you can ride longer & slower indoors using Springer Mountain, Koip or Conness.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

* **Name**: Collins +1
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 15 minutes
* **TSS**: 64.0

> 65-75% FTP and includes 3 late-ride sprints


### Thursday 

* **Name**: Gendarme +6

> Gendarme +6 consists of 3x15-minute sets of 30/30's where 30 seconds are spent
> at 130% FTP followed immediately by 30 seconds of active recovery.
> 
> The recovery valleys between between each set are 6.5 minutes long.

### Saturday 

* **Name**: Bear
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 119.0
* **NP**: 178
* **IF**: 89%

**Description**:

> Bear is 7 sets lasting about 5 minutes each consisting of 7x25-second VO2max

### Sunday 

* **Name**: Bondcliff
* **Duration**: 1 hour and 30 minutes
* **TSS**: 107.0
* **NP**: 168
* **IF**: 84%

**Description**:

> Bondcliff is made up of 4x15-minute race-start intervals that each begin with
> a 30-second surge at 150% FTP and then quickly settles in at 88% FTP for the
> remaining 14 minutes.
> 
> Each interval is separated by 3 minutes of recovery.

## Week 2

> Riding above FTP is tremendously productive, and it's also tremendously
> taxing. But by trimming down the interval durations and inserting short but
> adequate recovery valleys, you can accumulate quite a lot of time at this
> tough but productive output level without exhausting your muscles excessively.
> 
> Following another short, midweek Endurance + Sprints workout is a workout very
> similar to last week's only a bit more intense. This affords an opportunity to
> improve on something you may have struggled with, or it allows you to dress
> things up a bit. Maybe you'll spend some of the Anaerobic surges out of the
> saddle. Maybe you'll vary your cadence during a short burst or two every
> round. Or maybe you'll simply try to make each acceleration as smooth as
> possible thereby conserving as much energy as you can.
> 
> Then your first round of weekend abuse is a mild tweak on last weekend's race-
> simulation intervals where you can again try to achieve some form of
> improvement in the way you handle clusters of efforts this demanding.
> 
> Finally, last week's already long muscle endurance repeats grow even longer.
> If you find yourself in a bad spot, consider an occasional backpedal (no more
> than 30 seconds, and no more than 2 per interval) in order to keep your
> productivity and your cadence lifted. Think "smooth power", even if that means
> an infrequent and short impromptu recovery.
> 
> Same Sunday alternatives as last weekend: outdoors on sustained climbs with a
> couple sprints (10-30 seconds) plunked in, Springer Mountain, Koip or Conness.

> Each interval is separated by 5 minutes of recovery.

## Week 3

> Week 3 commences with one extra (but shorter) round of slightly-supra-
> threshold work where you'll continue to challenge your current sustainable
> power limits as you manage the accumulating fatigue and shorter recovery
> valleys without easing up.  
> 
> Work through another short Endurance rides plus a couple of mid-ride sprints
> and then face another trio of short/short clusters that grow their intensity
> once more. By now, you may have recognized your limit in terms of repeatable
> 30-second power. If so, feel free to dial the intensity down a notch or simply
> skip an occasional repeat (no more than 2 per set) if it allows you to leave
> the intensity alone.
> 
> Start your weekend with one last round of race-simulating VO2max + Sweet Spot
> intervals that tone things down slightly to compensate for Thursday's
> brutality. But fret not because they retain every bit of their relentless
> _on/barely off/on_  pattern of muscle and lung abuse.  
> 
> This pre-recovery weekend wraps up by bestowing upon thee an opportunity to
> make good use of that ever-reliable backpedal tactic, should you need it. By
> drawing each post-sprint Sweet Spot effort out to a full half hour, you're
> sure to occasionally question your ability to endure the discomfort as you
> reinforce your rising ability to withstand high, but not too-high, watts.
> 
> Yet again, some Sunday alternatives are to ride outdoors on sustained climbs
> where you'll add a couple of sprints, or stay indoors and endure Springer
> Mountain, Koip or Conness.

> 
> Each interval is separated by 7 minutes of recovery.

## Week 4

> Time to let the last few weeks of training soak in over the course of an easy
> week of riding. During this week, try not to lose sight of the fact that
> **adaptation happens during recovery** , not during the often muscle-damaging
> doses of high-intensity training that comprised much of the last few weeks.
>

> lessons await you out on the trail. If, however, you've recognized the benefit
> of recovery done correctly, you'll happily abide the low-intensity, same-

## Week 5

> With rested legs and a reinvigorated mind, it’s time for some new workout
> formats to further broaden your base of capabilities and to start to put a
> point on your high-level forms of fitness. Up first, a return to some more
> _traditional_ VO2max intervals that target that uber-productive 2- to 3-minute
> range and seek to further your versatile, high-end power capabilities.
> 
> Following an easy midweek ride that could be very well spent working on trail
> skills, you'll couple your hard-start prowess with your ability to accelerate,
> relent only slightly, then hit it hard again...and again, and again. Each set
> will cover a lot of different bases as several types of physical stress
> overlap one another in a very race-like manner.
> 
> Then, your fifth weekend of the plan begins with some extended and varied
> Sweet Spot work preceded by a short flurry of all-out sprint efforts. Use
> these to simulate the early demands of any XC race where positioning for
> pivotal course segments can come down to a single explosive burst of power.
> 
> Finally, square off against an hour's worth of Sweet Spot repeats that can be
> swapped out for a similar outdoor alternative or perhaps Boarstone if you
> choose to ride indoors.

## Week 6

> To start things off, your VO2max repeats grow in duration and drop the
> intensity slightly in order to compensate. If you struggled with the wattage
> last week, a slight drop in target power might be in order for these longer
> jobbers. Remember, it's not about survival, it's about productivity.
> Performing 2.5 high-power minutes steadily and with proper pedaling mechanics
> is far superior training than 2 minutes of fighting the bike and 30 seconds of
> falling apart during the closing seconds.  
>   
> Following a repeat of last week's easy spin (an excellent opportunity to work
> on outdoor skills if you have the opportunity), this week's iteration of hard
> starts + VO2max race repeats ups the demand of the initial sprint and slightly
> drops the intensity of the mid-interval surges. While the harder sprint could
> inspire slightly greater fatigue during the initial handful of surges, it's
> temporary fatigue that you can probably ride right through - as long as you
> tough it out long enough.  
>   
> Your weekend begins with a workout very, very similar to last week's mixed bag
> of race-like efforts. Do your best to muster some solid sprint efforts early
> on, in excess of the target watts  **if**  you feel up to the challenge, and
> then make the various steady-state efforts as smooth and seemingly effortless
> as possible. Look relaxed, be relaxed.  
> 
> This pre-taper week then closes with some longer Sweet Spot repeats that can
> be skipped in lieu of some similar-effort outdoor riding or some long, mild
> work done indoors (Boarstone works) or out.

## Week 7

> The first taper week of your Specialty training begins with your longest
> VO2max repeats yet, along with the addition of one crucial change: less
> recovery between intervals. This recovery reduction increases the aerobic
> demand earlier in each set considering the limited replenishment of your
> anaerobic resources.
> 
> If you're not quite up to this challenge, other versions of Old Rag exist, and
> they all include longer recovery valleys. Whichever version you settle on,
> prioritize interval quality above all else, whether short recoveries or long.
> 
> Following another skills-appropriate midweek spin, it's onto another round of
> a now familiar combination workout. This week drops the workout's volume but
> leaves the intensity untouched. Ideally, this is enough of a reduction in
> workload to allow your muscles to begin their rebound in anticipation of your
> peak event(s).
> 
> This final, pre-taper weekend then begins with a shorter version of your
> previous Sprints + Sweet Spot workouts and then closes out with one last
> shortened round of Sweet Spot work that can be swapped out as usual. Good
> indoor alternatives are Baxter or Fletcher.
