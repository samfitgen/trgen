# Trainer Road Plan: Olympic Distance Triathlon - Low Volume

> Trying to squeeze any final improvements out of your highest sustainable power
> & pace while also subjecting you to the exact types of rigors you'll face on
> race day, these final weeks of highly specialized training will challenge you
> in every possible way before tapering your training just in time for your key
> event(s).

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max Intervals (1900m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4;
> 6x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 5x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 6x100m Hard, RPE9 w/60s rest between intervals; 6x25m
> K &R drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Ramp Test** Time to account for the improvement yielded by the
> last 6 weeks of Build conditioning. You've had at least a couple runs at
> assessment, so try to pace really well and get a good measure of where your
> fitness resides heading into these more specialized workouts.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 10-15min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 to
> warm up, then repeat 8 Hard, RPE9, 90-second efforts, recovering for an equal
> 90 seconds after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down for a total of about
> 50 minutes of running
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold Intervals (2050m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 6x25m F

> easy, RPE4
> 
> _Saturday_ **Raymond +1** As we enter the final weeks of training leading up
> to your most important events and highest levels of fitness, the workouts will
> get increasingly similar to the demands of your events. In the case of the
> bike leg, this means that efforts above FTP get gradually closer to your FTP
> while the intervals grow in number and/or duration.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run 75 minutes Easy-Moderate, RPE 6

### Monday 

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Swim Base + VO2max Intervals


**Description**:

> Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4 6x25m CU drills w/ 10s rest between drills 5x100m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest between intervals 6x100m Hard, RPE9 w/60s rest
> between intervals 6x25m K&R; drills w/ 15s rest between drills Cool-Down 250m

### Wednesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!
