# Trainer Road Plan: Half Distance Triathlon - Mid Volume

> The mid-volume version of the Half Distance Triathlon specialty block is aimed
> at athletes looking to do more than just finish a half-distance course
> triathlon, rather these are athletes who are looking to be **competitive** at
> their target event but want to do so in a very time-efficient manner. Or
> events! Because by cutting the overall distances of these triathlons in half,
> half-distance triathletes can race successfully several times a season without
> burying themselves irrevocably in fatigue.
> 
> But excelling requires exceeding the event distances/durations in training,
> and it also requires a healthy blend of workout variety focused on making your
> 1.2 mile open water swim, 56-mile bike leg and 13+ miles of running not only
> doable but faster than you could expect from a lower-volume plan.
> 
> This race-specific block consists of 9-10 weekly workouts where you’re on the
> bike 3-4 times/week, swimming 3 times/week, running 3 times/week and
> completing a weekly brick (ride/run) workout either during the week or over
> the weekend.
> 
> This 8-week block furthers your workload for 6 weeks and then tapers your
> training during the final 2 weeks building to your key event at the end of the
> eighth & final week. On the way there, the fourth week is a recovery week
> which culminates in an optional tune-up Olympic distance triathlon in place of
> the scheduled brick workout should you be fortunate to compete in one.
> 
> Regardless of each week’s focus, you’ll be on the bike between 5-8 hours each
> week, less during your rest week, and roughly half of the usual time during
> the final 2 taper weeks.
> 
> Don’t let the structure of this block lead you believe you can’t move things
> around based on your non-training schedule & known recovery patterns - it’s
> flexible. And while we include recommendations on where to place your run &
> swim workouts, their composition is up to you.

## Week 1

> Following your Monday rest day, week 1 begins with a Tuesday morning swim
> workout and is followed later in the day with a trio of Threshold repeats that
> _could_ serve as a measure of recent improvements in your FTP should you feel
> that your highest sustainable effort has increased and you want to establish
> new training zones. Otherwise, just use them as a muscle endurance workout
> aimed at increasing your time to exhaustion and raising your long-distance
> power output. And if you prefer to assess FTP more formally, substitute the 20
> Minute Test in place of Marion.
> 
> Wednesday is an ideal time for a reasonably stressful run workout, and then
> Thursday pits you against your first of many brick workouts. During this one,
> you’ll ride very close to race power for an hour, transition quickly and run
> at race pace for a scant 20 minutes directly afterward in order to grow your
> familiarity with the discomfort of running off the bike. Do your best to keep
> your turnover quick during the first couple of miles and learn to work through
> the _clumsiness_ of this necessary shift in effort types.
> 
> Friday consists of a mild, aerobic spin which could be coupled with a swim
> workout earlier or later in the day, and then Saturday exposes you to your
> first long indoor endurance ride. Should you choose to do this ride outdoors,
> pad the duration to account for outdoor training disruptions. Depending on how
> frequently your steady riding is interrupted, up-adjust your training time by
> .3x to .5x. For example, a 3 hour ride could last as long as 4-5.5 hours
> depending on the level of disruptions. And it’s extremely important that
> you’re spending the far majority of your time riding in your aero position,
> indoors or out.
> 
> This long ride can be paired with a later afternoon/evening recovery run,
> maybe even some speed work, and then you’ll close your week with your long
> swim early on Sunday followed by your week’s longest run later that day.

## Week 2

> Your second week of training kicks off on Tuesday with short but taxing, post-
> swim efforts well above your FTP that will serve to elevate your highest
> sustainable, long-course power output.
> 
> Wednesday is again a good time for a fairly high-intensity run workout, then
> Thursday’s bike workout puts you back into the race-power realm in order to
> maintain and ideally further your aerobic efficiency thereby helping you spare
> your precious sugar stores even if only slightly more than usual. Later in the
> day is a good time to accumulate some running miles on mildly tired legs.
> 
> Friday’s bike workout bumps up last week’s time near race power, after which
> you can hit the pool for your second swim workout of the week sometime later
> in the day. Then get a good night’s rest in preparation for Saturday’s brick
> workout.
> 
> In this one, you’ll ride a little under 2 hours, in your aero position, at an
> intensity very similar to the one you’ll utilize on race day before hopping
> off the bike, transitioning into your running gear, and running for 40-50
> minutes at a pace similar to the pace you’ll target during your half marathon.
> 
> Finally, your week is capped off with your longest weekly swim followed later
> in the day by a long-ish run a bit below half-marathon pace.

## Week 3

> Following your first swim workout of the week, Week 3’s first bike workout has
> you in the saddle for another round of longer, strength-building,
> suprathreshold intervals again aimed at driving up your ability to put more
> power to the pedals over your bike leg’s duration.
> 
> Following your typical midweek run workout on Wednesday, Thursday’s midweek
> brick workout consists of another hour closer to or slightly above your likely
> race power output before asking your to transition directly into a 30-minute
> run done at or even slightly above your target race pace.
> 
> Friday grows the duration of your easy ride + later swim workout format and
> then you’ll move on to your weekend endurance ride on Saturday where you’ll
> nudge up the bike duration a bit while focusing on spending as much time as
> possible in your aero position with as few ride-time interruptions as you can
> manage. And remember, riding indoors can be equally as effective as
> substantially longer outdoor rides, rides lasting between 1.3-1.7x longer
> based on how steadily you’re allowed to turn the pedals at target power - no
> stoplights on a trainer!
> 
> Try to work a light run into your day later on, then Sunday will close this
> third week with a long swim early in the day and your week’s long run later
> that day.

Rest Day

## Week 4

> Week 4 is about two things: absorbing the stress of your previous training and
> building your fitness and confidence with an Olympic distance triathlon or a
> close simulation.
> 
> Owing to the fact that your fitness is high at this point in time, your
> Tuesday, post-swim bike workout won’t differ greatly in load from the previous
> weeks.
> 
> Wednesday is still a good day for a reasonably demanding run, but it’s best
> done at shorter durations just with similar intensity as previous weeks, and
> then Thursday will only ask you to ride near race power for an hour before
> logging some short but hefty - think speed work or hill repeats - later that
> day.
> 
> Friday will have you in the pool in the morning and then gives you a break
> from the bike, then Saturday will differ depending on your weekend’s options:
> race or race simulation.
> 
> If you plan to race on Sunday, keep Saturday short and easy with a low-
> intensity, 30-minute ride like Taku, then put all your training into action
> come Sunday.
> 
> If, on the other hand, you’re planning to simulate your race, your brick
> workout will consist of a sub-hour ride followed immediately by a 45-minute
> run, both near race pace. Do your best to move directly from the swim to the
> brick workout and keep this as close to the demands of your upcoming race as
> possible by rolling from one event to the next with smooth, relaxed and quick
> transitions.
> 
> Close your week the next day with a reduced-duration long swim and an equally
> shortened, recovery-week long run.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 5

> Time to get back at it, but if you competed in an Olympic distance tri last
> weekend then you might need an extra day of rest this week - listen to your
> body. If that’s not the case though, get things rolling with some longer
> muscle endurance intervals with Tuesday’s post-swim, Threshold-repeat ride.
> 
> Following Wednesday’s run workout, you’ll face another midweek brick, this
> time made up of a little over an hour very near race power followed by 30
> minutes of controlled, fluid running done slightly below your target race
> pace.
> 
> Friday’s bike and swim combo should both be toward the easy end of the
> spectrum, and then Saturday brings you your longest endurance ride yet, one
> you might choose to follow with some speed or hill running later that day.
> 
> And whether you choose to do the bike workout indoors or outdoors, don’t
> hesitate to push the duration up to match your anticipated bike split. In
> other words, if you expect a 4-hour bike split on a particularly nasty course
> come race day, you’re welcome to work in a 4-hour ride today as long as the
> extra duration doesn’t progress this ride’s stress too high too quickly - be
> sensible.
> 
> Finally, wrap up the week with your long swim and run and earn that Monday
> rest day.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 6

> One more week before you start to taper and shed some fatigue, but not before
> you get through this beast of a week which kicks off with a morning swim and
> then another round of noticeably longer muscle endurance intervals spent
> largely or entirely in your aero position.
> 
> Following your Wednesday run workout, Thursday brings your longest, midweek
> workout near race power in an attempt to further your aerobic efficiency just
> a bit more during these final pre-event days. Follow this later with some
> _speed-spiced_ running miles and then call it a day.
> 
> Friday’s ride/swim combo starts with another race-pace bike workout but can be
> swapped out for an easier, shorter ride like Pettit in prep for a weekend that
> revolves around your penultimate brick workout.
> 
> This particular brick will bring you as close to your race durations and
> intensities as you’re going to get during this final training block, so treat
> it as though it’s the real thing and that includes a pre-brick swim if you can
> swing it. You’ll hold race pace for a solid 2 hours and then transition
> directly to your race-pace run for 60 minutes afterward.
> 
> This week’s done and dusted once you get in a long swim on Sunday but keep the
> long run to under an hour or skip it entirely if you know you’re truly spent
> and won’t be able to maintain proper running form from start to finish.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 7

> Time to cut the volume way down, keep the intensity right where it is, and
> start to unearth that freshness over the next two weeks leading up to race
> day. It all starts with what could be your week’s longest swim coupled later
> in the day with a couple of long Sweet Spot repeats on the bike before moving
> onto your Wednesday, reduced-volume/same-intensity run workout.
> 
> Thursday is almost entirely about intensity with very little volume and will
> familiarize you with the race openers that are also scheduled the day before
> your event. Follow this workout later in the day with a set of running strides
> and then rest up.
> 
> Friday is a good day to take it easy with a light skills-oriented day in the
> pool and then Saturday brings a relatively light day on the bike with just
> under a couple hours of relatively easy riding that should be followed later
> that day with a short but intense run.
> 
> Then the week closes with taper-reduced versions of your previous long swim
> and run workouts.

### Sunday 

Rest Day

## Week 8

> With race day only days away, it’s time to drop the volume a bit more bringing
> your workout durations down even lower than last week’s while, you guessed it,
> keeping every bit of the intensity starting with a short swim and a set of
> Sweet Spot repeats that can be trimmed as you see fit. Don’t feel like you
> need 3 repeats? Make it 2. Still a bit hefty? Try a single 15-minute effort.
> 
> After a short but no less intense run workout on Wednesday, Thursday offers a
> relatively short but confidence-boosting, jitters-demolishing race rehearsal
> in the form of your final brick workout where you’ll perform a couple race-
> power repeats and then zing through a quick transition run lasting between
> 20-30 minutes consisting of race-pace (or even slightly above race-pace)
> running.
> 
> Friday is nothing more than a short, fast swim workout while Saturday is
> reserved for a reduced-duration version of last week’s race openers workout,
> one you can pair with a short set of running strides afterward.
> 
> Then that’s it! You’ve done the work, you’ve tapered the workload and properly
> diminished your fatigue, and there’s nothing more to do than rest up, nourish
> properly and reassure yourself that you’ve done what’s necessary to have your
> best possible day on Sunday. Good luck & race smart!
