# Trainer Road Plan: Olympic Triathlon Build - Mid Volume

> These Build blocks place increasing importance on not only extending but
> sustaining your soon-to-be-elevated power & pace. Enduring some rather high-
> level discomfort is challenging but necessary in order to push you to this new
> level of performance.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_   **Ramp Test**  With 6 weeks of base work in your legs, it's time
> to reassess your FTP in order to keep your workouts in line with your
> increasing fitness. Stick with the same workout format (Ramp Test, 8 Minute
> FTP Test or 20 Minute FTP Test) that you used the first time and count this as
> the first strength-endurance workout of your Tri Build training block.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max Intervals (2325m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 8x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 7x75m Hard, RPE9 w/ 45s rest between intervals; 8x25m
> KDrills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Run 10-15min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6
> to warm up, then repeat 16 Hard, RPE 9, 30-second efforts, recovering for only
> 30 seconds after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down for a total of about
> 40 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Mills** Upping the volume of your hardest VO2max workout to date
> by a full set of 3 intervals may sound a bit hefty, but these 'peak and fade'
> repeats are a little more forgiving than the steadier format, and there's even
> a little bit of rest between each set. So if you made intensity reductions to
> in the past, see how a few of these intervals go before making reductions here
> - you may be pleasantly surprised.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Speed Intervals (2300m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m F &T drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/
> 45s rest between intervals; 4x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 8x25m SK drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Run 40min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> randomly insert 8x30s bursts of high speed, RPE9 over the course of your run
> with at least a minute's recovery between each fluid, high-speed effort.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Frissell** With a solid base of Sweet Spot endurance in your
> legs, it's time to start gravitating more toward intended race pace. Spending
> time slightly below your FTP is both beneficial in this respect but it's also
> likely that you'll spend most your bike leg working at an effort level very
> close to the high percentage of FTP you'll sustain during each of these
> 9-minute repeats. Make sure you're spending ample time in your aero position
> while still keeping your Target power at the top of your priorities.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2200m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE 4; 1,500m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** Run 80min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 but try to keep your
> running as continuous as possible.

Rest Day


### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> _Tuesday_ **Dade -1** Building on last week's 'diminishing' format, this round
> of VO2max repeats will hold you steadily at your highest aerobic output for
> the entire 2 minutes. Knock the intensity down a bit if you must, but by now
> you ought to be learning how to gut out these short, intense intervals without
> giving up any of their potential productivity.

> efforts, recovering for only 30 seconds after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to
> cool down for a total of about 40 minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Red Lake +3**  If working slightly below FTP strengthens the base
> for increases in FTP, working slightly above it serves to actualize those
> increases. Use these short but uncomfortable efforts to grow your boundaries,
> both physically and mentally - grow accustomed to the pain rather than trying
> to avoid it. If possible, spend some time in your aero posture, but on-Target
> power is still the top priority.
>

> less volume, run 35min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and randomly insert 8x30s bursts of
> high speed, RPE9 over the course of your run with at least a minute's recovery
> between each fluid, high-speed effort.
>

> bike workout, you'll sustain 75 minutes of effort between 80-85% FTP pushing
> you closer to the effort you'll try to hold during your race-day bike leg.
> Then, you'll dismount and transition quickly into your running gear right
> before you take off on a fairly short30-minute run at an Easy-Moderate, RPE6
> pace in order to get a feel for running off the bike as well as accumulating a
> bit of additional run mileage.

## Week 3

> _Tuesday_ **Shortoff +1** The greatest benefit of VO2max works comes with
> longer durations at that high aerobic uptake. By adding a minute to each of
> these intervals, you actually gain more than a minute's benefit since this
> extra time is spent at an already highly elevated workload. But keeping things
> elevated means not taking any breaks, and if small reductions in intensity are
> necessary to keep you powering along, shave a few percentage points and keep
> those pedals turning.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max Intervals (2400m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;

> seconds after each; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down for a total of about 45
> minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Red Lake +4** Same level of effort a little above FTP, same
> relatively generous recovery valleys, but a little more time at intensity this
> week, all aimed at increasing your ability to ride above your current
> capabilities. Again, ride aero if possible, but the greater concern here is
> your ability to sustain steady watts slightly above your FTP.

> smoother form this time, still separating each by a minute's running back at
> RPE6.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Frissell +1** Building on this same format from a couple weeks
> ago, you'll again repeat efforts slightly below your FTP which is both
> beneficial in terms of increased sustainable power, but also in that you'll
> probably spend most your bike leg working at or very close to this percentage
> of your FTP. Spend as much time as possible in your aero position as long as

> 400m Easy Warm-Up (RPE4) 1000m Hard (RPE9) 400m Easy Cool-Down (RPE4)

#### Workout 2
* **Name**: Base Run
* **Duration**: 1 day and 21 hours


**Description**:

> Run 45min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 taking the occasional 1-minute walk-break
> when/if necessary to maintain your form.

## Week 5

> _Tuesday_ **Givens** As you adjust to VO2max efforts lasting 3 full minutes
> each, a new objective enters the mix: determining how hard you can work for 3
> minutes at a time and still repeat the effort productively. For some, 110% FTP
> is their max repeatable 3-minute power but for others, efforts all the way up
> at 130% FTP are possible. Find your breaking point, but don't surpass it -
> modify the Workout Intensity accordingly such that you complete each 3-minute
> torture test, barely.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base + VO2max Intervals (2400m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m BB Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 7x100m Hard, RPE9 w/ 30s rest between intervals; 8x25m
> K &R; drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Run VO2max Intervals** Time to really stretch the interval
> duration. Run your 10-15min up to Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 to warm up, then run 3
> Hard, RPE 9, 3-minute efforts as hard as you can go, recovering for 3 minutes
> after each effort; run 10min Easy, RPE 4 to cool down for a total of about 40
> minutes of running
> 
> _Thursday_ **Elephants** Having already crammed 30 minutes of this type of
> work into the same workout duration, this week's challenge trims each
> interval's duration a little but also trims the recovery valleys
> substantially. Shorter intervals, shorter rest, greater eventual endurance
> during your suprathreshold workloads, higher FTP too.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Threshold + Speed Intervals (2500m)** Warm-Up 300m Easy, RPE4;
> 8x25m F drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 7x200m Moderate-Hard, RPE8 w/ 20s
> rest between intervals; 4x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE 10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 8x25m K drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 300m easy, RPE4
> 
> _Friday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Another near-repeat of previous weeks'
> speed-work this time totaling 50min of Easy-Moderate, RPE6 running and 8
> randomly placed 30-second bursts of high speed, RPE9 with at least a minute of
> steady running between each burst.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Kaweah** Upping the interval duration by just a minute over
> previous weeks' strength-endurance sessions, this bout of work will offer a
> few opportunities to push slightly closer to your FTP and see if a few extra
> watts are reasonable on race day give the post-bike 10k run that will await
> you.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2700m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE 4; 2000m
> Easy-Moderate, RPE 6; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE 4
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** Run 90min Easy-Moderate, RPE 6 and again try to keep
> your running as continuous as possible.

## Week 6

> _Tuesday_ **Owens** Getting a little creative with your suffering this week,
> you'll face an assortment of efforts in the VO2max realm that not only vary
> the intensity but trim your usual 1:1 work-rest ratio down to a point where
> your recoveries are a little less generous and more aerobically demanding. All
> of this adds up to more time spent at a high aerobic uptake, less time spent
> drifting away from that high rate of respiration, and in time, greater
> improvements in sustainable power.

> throughout.
