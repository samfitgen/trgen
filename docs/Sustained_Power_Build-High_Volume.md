# Trainer Road Plan: Sustained Power Build - High Volume

> Coming off some steadily high-TSS base training and necessarily adequate
> recovery following the preceding high-volume training block, you likely find
> yourself eager to do the work necessary to lift your sustained-power
> capabilities even higher. This plan will pursue that outcome from a number of
> different angles, all effective in terms of increasing your strength
> endurance, fatigue resistance and that ever-important mental ability to
> withstand long bouts of relentless discomfort.
> 
> Whether you're a road racer, a time trialist or multisport athlete, a marathon
> mountain biker or perhaps a century or gran fondo participant, pushing the
> pedals hard and doing it for a long time is a necessity.
> 
> It's for this very reason that the Sustained Power Build plans were developed
> -- to more specifically build your ability to push high, steady watts without
> fading over lengthy durations during multi-hour events.

## Week 1

> As you'd expect, Week 1 offers your first crack at assessing any improvements
> in fitness that your base training may have conveyed. While the Ramp Test is
> recommended, you're welcome to swap it with our 20 Minute FTP Test or 8 Minute
> FTP Test if you prefer that format.
> 
> You'll next face an unusually long midweek Endurance ride to make up for the
> lower-TSS assessment workout before moving on to a round of slightly
> suprathreshold repeats immediately followed by a stretch of Endurance work
> that keeps tomorrow's TSS-filler on the shorter end of things.
> 
> Then, the week wraps up with what promises to be a common combination for the
> next few weeks. Your Saturday workout consists of a healthy dose of over-
> unders to help you get an even better feel for where exactly you cross that
> lactic line, all while helping you push that line higher.
> 
> Finally, some long stretches of Sweet Spot work will tone down the intensity
> but keep the focus on increasing your muscular stamina during your final
> workout of each week. But for those riders looking to go the long/slow route,
> Big Squaw carries a very similar TSS with the addition of a half hour in the
> saddle.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> Even lower-intensity, steady-state cyclists benefit from a bit of the hard
> stuff; in particular, some VO2max work. So week 2 begins with your first taste
> of maximum aerobic power repeats followed immediately by 15 minutes of aerobic
> Endurance work that will both further your ability to use fat as fuel and also
> drop the duration of tomorrow's Endurance ride a little bit.
> 
> Up next, another extended set of not-quite-Threshold/not-quite-VO2max
> intervals that ride the line between power you can hold -- and repeat -- for
> multiple minutes and efforts that are either too hard to sustain or too long
> to really tax your aerobic upper end. The additional 30 minutes of Endurance
> work are aimed at both increasing your ability to metabolize fat as fuel and
> keeping your Friday TSS-filler short and sweet.
> 
> The weekend combo stays true to last week's intentions but grows the demands
> of both workouts, if only slightly in both cases. And if you'd rather go
> easier but longer on Sunday, slot Town Hill in place of the prescribed
> alternate-version Wright Peak.

## Week 3

> Week 3 starts with a VO2max workout strikingly similar to last week's but with
> a slight upward bump in duration. This added workload is aimed at holding you
> at a higher level of oxygen uptake meaning you'll breathe a little harder for
> longer, maybe recover a little more slowly, but heap a little more stress on
> your evolving aerobic system.
> 
> Following a reasonably mild aerobic spin, you'll move on to a set of longer,
> more demanding suprathreshold repeats that will force to you manage the lactic
> flooding for a couple extra minutes each interval while you further your
> ability to tolerate pain and put all that lactate to good use.
> 
> And what a better way to close out this pre-recovery week than by asking you
> to take last week's demanding combo and make both workouts just a little bit
> more challenging, and productive.
> 
> And this weekend's optional long-ride substitute is again Town Hill or an
> outdoor ride of similar or preferably longer duration considering the
> interruptions in training stress you're likely to encounter out on the open
> road.

## Week 5

> In the event your sustainable power has increased, we'll want to adjust your
> training zones appropriately, so Week 5 begins with a Ramp Test, an assessment
> workout you're welcome to switch for the 8 Minute FTP Test or the 20 Minute
> FTP Test based on whichever format helps you remain consistent over the course
> of your season.
> 
> Following a slightly extended aerobic Endurance ride, we'll tone down your
> lactate tolerance interval intensity but lift the duration in order to keep
> your muscles mildly flooded and force you to sustain the burn and benefit from
> the discomfort in the process.
> 
> The weekend brings with it a new combination of muscle-endurance workouts
> aimed at driving up your FTP some more. It starts with a round of Threshold
> repeats that will push you very close to your FTP without every nudging you
> all the way up to it.
> 
> Then, you'll back the intensity off somewhat and bank a lot of time riding in
> the Sweet Spot -- not excessively demanding, but nowhere near easy, and chalk
> full of potential stamina-enhancing goodness. And there's even a little forced
> recovery in there, our gift to you.
> 
> As usual, you have the option of going longer and less intensely on Sunday,
> and Maclure is a good 3-hour swap for the 2-hour version of Wright Peak that's
> scheduled.

> Week 6's initial challenge pits you against 2 sets of marginally longer

> workout's worth of them can stir adaptation in even the fittest of athletes.
> Add to that an extra 15 minutes of Endurance work and all facets of your
> aerobic system will get its due attention.
> 
> Following a midweek TSS-filler, you'll face some mercifully shorter lactate
> tolerance repeats (but more of them). Much like last week, if the short
> recoveries aren't ones that will allow you to rally and survive the bulk of
> each interval, consider a short workout pause in order to continue to maximize
> the training benefit from these slightly supra-threshold work bouts.
> 
> Your weekend combo stays the strength-endurance course and only grows the
> demands of both workouts slightly. But it's enough to constitute progression
> and keep those high-end endurance capabilities on the rise. And Town Hill or a
> longer outdoor ride are both good longer/milder substitutes.
