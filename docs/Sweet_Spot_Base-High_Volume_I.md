# Trainer Road Plan: Sweet Spot Base - High Volume I

## Week 1

> This first week is dedicated to assessing your current fitness and then
> heaping on the first heavy dose of Sweet Spot work as you embark on your
> journey toward greater muscle endurance.
> 
> Each Friday will be set aside for some lighter, aerobic endurance work aimed
> at increasing your fat-metabolizing capabilities; this workout can be
> shortened, toned down, or skipped if you feel like you're carrying enough
> fatigue into the weekend to hinder your longer, more demanding workouts.
> 
> If you'd rather ride long and "easy" on Sunday, try Town Hill instead.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> Week 2 raises the overall stress load enough to overload your current level of
> muscle endurance, but ideally not so much that you can't keep up with the
> workouts. On those days where the level of effort seems a little out of reach,
> try a small, 5% reduction in Workout Intensity - this will keep things on
> track while being a little more forgiving. If you encounter more than one of
> these days in a single week, you might want to reconsider using this high-
> volume training plan.
> 
> Prefer something milder but longer in duration on Sunday? Give Big Squaw a
> shot.

## Week 3

> Week 3 brings another increase in total weekly Sweet Spot volume; this is

> your longer, 2-hour workouts.
