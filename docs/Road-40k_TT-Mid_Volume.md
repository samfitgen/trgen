# Trainer Road Plan: 40k TT - Mid Volume

> The 40k TT plans will prepare you for longer, more sustained efforts at higher
> percentages of functional threshold power (FTP). We know this type of fitness
> as muscular endurance. Growing muscular endurance is synonymous with building
> stamina. By increasing both your maximum steady-state power and stamina,
> you'll be able to work harder for longer durations.
> 
> If you're pursuing a 40-kilometer time trial or looking to increase your
> maximum steady-state power (aka your highest sustainable power), you should
> follow the 40k TT plan after you've completed your Base and Build phase plans.

## Week 1

> Your specialized training begins with a Ramp Test, but remain consistent with
> your assessment protocol of choice. If you've been loyal to either the 8
> Minute FTP Test or the 20 Minute FTP Test, consider this an opportunity to
> perform one or two steady-state efforts in your time trial position while
> refining your pacing capabilities.  
> 
> After an abnormally long midweek Endurance ride, your next key workout of this
> first week will be an actual practice time trial and a good opportunity to
> grasp whether or not your estimated FTP is in line with your actual time-trial
> power. This also serves as an introduction to pacing a long, near-continuous
> effort and a chance to address any bike fit issues that might limit your
> ability to lay down some high, steady-state power for a duration approaching
> your intended 40k time.
> 
> And always feel free to look for +/- versions of your scheduled practice time
> trial should you wish to increase or decrease the severity of the workout.  
> 
> Following another dayâ€™s recovery, your weekend begins with a dose of intervals
> that will repeatedly expose you to work done slightly below your newly
> estimated FTP, all in the same vein of this week's primary intent: reinforce
> your time trial stamina. This first week then closes with your first
> 'progression workout' which offers continuous but mildly varied effort levels
> all done near your time trial power. This workout format can be highly
> effective at increasing your endurance near FTP but also underscores the
> importance of starting conservatively and increasing your effort as the
> workout or race progresses.  
> 
> If you'd rather ride long and easy on Sunday, you can accumulate the same
> level of TSS in a lower-intensity manner by riding Warren, Boarstone, or
> heading outdoors for a matched-TSS ride done between 60-75% FTP.

### Tuesday 

* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

## Week 2

> Week 2 begins with your first round of slightly suprathreshold repeats that
> will ideally be performed in your time trial position whenever possible. If
> this level of intensity prevents you from riding low, an important decision
> has to be made: modify your position or accept a lower power output and slower
> finish time than your fitness actually supports.  
> 
> Up next, your midweek Endurance ride trims down to a shorter duration allowing
> you to spin off some of yesterday's fatigue. If you're yearning for some
> riding done in an upright position, today is a good time to take a break from
> aero work.
> 
> Your second practice TT lifts the workout duration slightly by extending each
> pacing quadrant by a single minute, but the short recoveries within this
> simulated TT grow a bit to compensate. The goal here is to increase your aero-
> position muscle stamina and reduce the likelihood of breaking position and
> sacrificing precious time as your time trials enter their third and fourth
> quarters.
> 
> Moving to your second weekend, you'll first spend some manageably long
> stretches of time targeting the ability to apply steady power down low and
> only slightly below your FTP. Working this close to your threshold power
> carries all the benefits of riding right at FTP, but does so with a somewhat
> lighter toll on your mind and muscles.
> 
> You'll close out this second week with another progression workout that tacks
> on an extra 10-minute segment potentially making this a workout where you'll
> spend **more** time driving the pedals  than you will during your peak
> event(s). Knowing you can outlast your goal duration, even at lower
> intensities, goes a long way toward building the confidence necessary to hurt
> steadily for an entire hour.
> 
> Your lower-intensity options this week are Koip and Boarstone, and of course,
> an outdoor ride with a similar TSS via watts in that 60-75% FTP range.

## Week 3

> Week 3 begins with another round of suprathreshold repeats only slightly
> longer in duration than last week's, and one less of them meaning the workload
> is nearly the same. The aim here is to subtly lift your time-trial power, but
> just as importantly, to help you adjust to mildly-suprathreshold work
> performed in your aero position.
> 
> Following a short, easy day in the saddle, one you're welcome to perform in an
> upright position if you'd like, you'll endure your longest practice TT yet. By
> now you've likely recognized that these workouts utilize a consistent pre-TT
> warmup format and then provide several more learning opportunities - proper
> pacing, working in position, the challenge of steady output - over 4 near-
> continuous segments at commonly utilized 40k power percentages. This one
> differs slightly by offering exposure to a 5-segment time trial in order to
> illustrate one of many alternative pacing strategies.
> 
> Your weekend then begins with another round of stamina-reinforcing Threshold
> intervals performed in your aero position. Their duration drops a bit, but the
> addition of another repeat brings your total work time up a bit higher than
> last week - more time down low, but more manageable durations to balance
> things out.
> 
> You'll close out this third week of overload with the longest progression
> workout of this training phase which amounts to a total of 80 steady minutes
> of work; all but guaranteeing a longer effort than you'll face in competition.
> 
> Lower/longer options this week? Try Big Squaw or Ptarmigan or head outdoors.

## Week 4

> The fourth week of your Specialty plan probably finds you fatigued and longing
> for a bit of a break from the intensity. Some athletes need a stretch of
> recovery every 3 weeks while some can wait until that 5th week, but  _most_
> riders see a decline in performance after 3 consistent weeks of loading. Dial
> things back for a few days, maintain your training schedule  and try to place
> an added emphasis on your sleep if you can (shoot for an extra hour a few
> nights this week). Also, do your best to avoid unnecessary stress or excessive
> physical activity whenever possible.

## Week 5

> The second half of this Specialty plan keeps the weekly stress similar to the
> first half.  This allows riders the chance to gradually unearth fitness buried
> beneath the fatigue of the Build phase as they hone said fitness to be as
> specific as possible to their key event; in this case a near-FTP, steady-state
> effort.
> 
> Although FTP improvements aren't a key focus at this point in the training
> progression, any improvements in FTP **will** make a measurable impact on your
> performance capabilities since you'll then be working at higher power outputs
> over the course of these final 4 weeks and beyond. It never gets easier, you
> only get faster, right?
> 
> So you'll start with another FTP assessment. Again, perform this effort in
> your aero position, and if you choose to utilize either the 8 Minute FTP Test
> or the 20 Minute FTP Test, pace just like you'd pace the longer efforts (see a
> "Four-Quarters" breakdown in the  _Week Tips_ ), and see if you've raised your
> FTP.
> 
> Then, following an easy, cadence-driven Endurance ride, you'll face yet
> another practice TT to further refine your position, pacing and focus while
> also reinforcing your time trial stamina, all for just a minute longer than
> last time and returning to a 4-quarter pacing routine. Consider fully kitting
> up, all the way up. Don your skinsuit, your shoe covers, aero helmet,
> sunglasses or visor of choice, anything and everything you have at your
> disposal and plan to utilize on race day. You might consider an extra fan, as
> well.
> 
> Come the weekend, your Threshold repeats grow a little in duration with a
> similar aim, to increase your time to exhaustion at effort levels very close
> to your time trial power. You'll then repeat the same progression workout you
> faced in week 3 to close out this fifth week of specialization.
> 
> Milder but longer ride options this week are that same as week 3: Big Squaw,
> Ptarmigan or head outdoors.

## Week 6

> Just one week separates you from the blessed training reduction that is your
> 2-week taper, and it brings no surprises with its familiar mix of workouts and
> steady-TSS total. Week 6 begins with your longest set of  _Threshold+_ efforts
> just a skosh above your maximum steady-state power. As you probably guessed,
> the primary aim is to eke out any last, little increases in your FTP while the
> secondary aim is to confirm your ability to work in close proximity to that
> FTP while remaining low and narrow: aero.  
> 
> Following a very easy, very short recovery spin, you'll head into the longest
> practice TT you'll face over this entire 8-week training plan. Draw
> encouragement from the promise that an hour-long time trial ridden outdoors
> simply won't be as hard as this indoor sufferfest. Get through this one and
> practically everything else will pale in comparison. And if you'd rather ride
> continuously, look for other versions of this particular practice TT.
> 
> Then, one more weekend foray into slightly-subthreshold territory where the
> efforts grow to their longest duration, but so do their recovery valleys which
> are aimed at keeping your work quality high from interval to interval. By now,
> these should be performed entirely in your aero position with perhaps the
> occasional break to stand for a few pedalstrokes or to grab a quick drink
> should you plan to carry a bottle.  
> 
> Finally, another progression workout that mildly reduces its demands over your
> most recent equivalents. Given the work you've already done this week, you're
> fully entitled to a lighter version of this brand of workout to close out this
> final week of overload. In addition to the strength-endurance benefit on
> offer, this workout is yet another opportunity to reinforce the night and day
> difference between going out conservatively vs. going out too hard.
> 
> The lower-intensity options are the same as week 2 with Koip and Boarstone as
> pretty close TSS equivalents if you choose to stay inside, a similar-TSS ride
> with watts in the 60-75% FTP range if you venture outdoors.

> yet, as well as your Threshold repeats. If you feel like this isn't enough
> work to sustain your fitness, don't worry,  **it is**. Your aim  over these
> final two weeks is not to try to elevate your fitness but to uncover it by
> removing any last bit of fatigue that could limit your race performance.
> 
> Saturday is an  _openers_  workout based on a Sunday time trial, but if your
> TT falls on Saturday, perform the short priming workout on Friday instead. And
> if you'd prefer a different openers workout, take a look at Truuli -2 or find
> something similar in format and TSS.
> 
> If for some reason you aren't racing this weekend, it's a good idea to slot in
> a repeat of one of your practice TT's in place of an outdoor race.
> 
> Beyond that, consider the work  **done**. Draw confidence from the fact that
> youâ€™ve put forth all thatâ€™s necessary to have a great race, and  recognize
> that thereâ€™s absolutely no need to cram any last-minute sessions into your
> schedule - they'll only work against you. Get out there, have a great day, and

> Cajon is a pre-race warmup for events that will require long, sustained
> efforts.
> 
> Starting with a gradual ramp and 1-minute effort at 80% FTP, you then get a
> chance to collect yourself before a 80-90% 5-minute ramp.
> 
> After this primer, the warmup becomes more event-specific with a 8-minute
> effort at 92% FTP. This sub-threshold TT effort will make sure you're body is
> primed and ready for the consistent effort that lies ahead.
