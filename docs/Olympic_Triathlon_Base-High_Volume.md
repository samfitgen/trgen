# Trainer Road Plan: Olympic Triathlon Base - High Volume

> The high-volume version of the Olympic Triathlon Base plan has triathletes
> swimming four times each week for up to 9600m, on the bike four times each
> week for up to 6 hours total (including a few brick workouts), and running for
> right around 3 hours each week.
> 
> This high-level plan is aimed at experienced Olympic distance triathletes who
> are intent on a top-10 placing, maybe a podium spot, perhaps even an age-group
> title. These 6 weeks will help you develop a firm base of fitness in all 3
> disciplines relying on no more than 12 hours per week.
> 
> Note: Double-day workouts can be done in any order and separated by as little
> or as much time as you choose, as long as you can keep the quality of both
> workouts high.

## Week 1

> _Tuesday_ **Swim Base Intervals + Sprints (2200m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 10x25m CU Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 9x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; 4x25m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest between
> sprints; 10x25m K Drills w/ 15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m easy,
> RPE4.
> 
> _Tuesday_   **FTP Assessment**  Get a solid estimate of your current fitness
> via the Ramp Test. You have the option of using the 8-minute FTP Test or the
> 20 Minute FTP Test if you prefer, just see to it that you reassess using the
> same workout each time.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2050m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 10x25m FS
> Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 11x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s rest
> between intervals; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run** 40min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Feel free to
> insert 1 minute of walking whenever necessary as you try to run more
> continuously from week to week and emphasize quality over quantity at this
> early point in your running. Try to run for at least 12 minutes between
> walking breaks if possible.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Shasta** Time to build some capacity! In particular, strength. By
> drilling it for a short 20 seconds at a time, your muscles will receive a
> loud-and-clear request for more - more muscle, more work, more power. This is
> true, on-the-bike strength work that will not only lift your ability to power
> the pedals for short durations but also much, much longer ones.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run** 40min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6, still sprinkling in
> a few 1-minute walking breaks if your form or control starts to slip.
> 
> _Friday_ **Slide Mountain** Down at the lower end of the Sweet Spot range,
> these 3 efforts will tone things down enough to keep your endurance in check
> while still allowing for ample time spent in your aero position. If it’s been
> a while since you’ve gotten low, just stay low for durations that work for
> you, sit up as often and as long as necessary, and use later workouts to grow
> these spans of time spent low.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed + Sprint Intervals (2300m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 10x25m F drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x150m of 50m Easy, RPE4/25m Hard,
> RPE8, 15s rest between intervals; 4x50m Sprints, All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest
> between sprints; 10x25m K drills w/15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m
> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Antelope** 50 total minutes of endurance work comprise your
> weekend ride as you face fairly long intervals and quite a few of them.
> Fortunately, the recovery between each interval is pretty generous in the
> interest of keeping the steady, endurance-building watts comin’ for each of
> the 5 intervals. See if you can spend 1 or 2 of these 10-minute jobbers mostly
> or entirely in your aero position.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 35min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> then conclude your run with two 20-second controlled sprints, RPE10,
> preferably uphill w/ 40 seconds of recovery between them. Keep the grade
> gentle enough that you can generate a bit of speed and maintain fluid form,
> even up a hill.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2000m)** Warm-Up 250m Easy, RPE4; 1500m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 250m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 50min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Again, walk briefly
> when necessary if it means the difference between running well and sacrificing
> form while running efficiency suffers. Quick walking breaks of a single minute
> can often keep the form high while costing very little in terms of aerobic
> fitness improvements.

### Tuesday 

#### Workout 1
* **Name**: Ramp Test
* **Duration**: 25 minutes
* **TSS**: 34.0
* **NP**: 182
* **IF**: 91%

**Description**:

> The Ramp Test is an assessment workout that uses gradual increases in Target
> Power to push you as hard as possible over the course of a fairly short but
> demanding, continuous effort.
> 
> The first half of the workout takes place at low enough intensities that you
> should not require any extra warming. It begins with a very light 5 minutes of
> easy pedaling around 50% of your FTP, and then Target Power slightly increases
> every minute, on the minute. Simply match your watts to the Target Power and
> hang in there for as long as you can.
> 
> Typically, the test lasts between 16-20 minutes and really doesn't feel too
> uncomfortable until those final few minutes. At that time, it's imperative
> that you **really** push yourself. Keep turning those pedals over until you
> simply cannot maintain Target Power any longer.  
> 
> There is no requirement to finish your final minute in order to get a proper
> FTP estimate, and even lasting a few seconds into your final step will
> influence your new FTP estimate. **Every second** **counts**.  
> 
> Stay seated for the entire test, and don't worry about any specific cadence.
> Simply turn the pedals until you can't reach the goal power any longer. The
> test is complete as soon as you are unable to pedal or your watts begin
> dropping, and there is no benefit to continuing once your watts start to fall.
> 
> Good luck, ride hard!

> 
> _Thursday_ **Mount Field**  You'll be growing last week's endurance demand by
> a couple of minutes per interval. This is your first of many opportunities to
> gradually work up your ability to keep turning the pedals at watts that are

> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run** 45min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Keep using the
> walking breaks if necessary and keep growing your continuous running bouts as
> you work toward steady, no-break runs.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Seneca Rocks** The goals here are time in the Sweet Spot to grow
> your muscle endurance at reasonably high, sustained levels of power while also
> integrating increasingly longer segments of time down in your aero riding
> position. Rise when the power starts to stray off Target, but get low again as
> soon as you can in order to work toward longer and longer aero durations.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run** What? Another Base Run lasting 45min at Easy-Moderate
> pace, RPE6? Yup. Be smart, walk if necessary but for no more than a minute and
> no more frequently than 4 times.
> 
> _Friday_ **Mont Albert +1** This one’s still about steady-effort repeats
> around the Sweet Spot power range and this time you’ll see intervals of
> different durations just to keep things spicy, woohoo! If over the course of
> these longer efforts you find yourself underchallenged and you’re recovering
> well between bike workouts, see how the tallest, third interval goes and then
> consider adding 2-3% to your FTP during later Sweet Spot workouts in order to
> determine if your FTP could use a little adjustment. And make sure you’re
> spending some time in the position you’ll use on the road too - aero bars,
> clip-on’s, drops; whatever you’ll use come race day.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed + Sprint Intervals (2500m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;

> 
> _Saturday_ **Hunter** If you handled last Saturday’s 3x20 with 5-minute
> breaks, then this week promises to be a bit more manageable if slightly longer
> overall. See if you can grow your aero time even more, but don’t sacrifice any
> power in your quest to stay low for longer. Start finding the balance between
> low and powerful and keep Target Power at the forefront of your goals.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Base Run + Uphill Strides** Run 35min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> then conclude your run with 6x20s controlled sprints, RPE10, preferably uphill
> w/ 40s of recovery between them.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2300m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4; 1500m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 400m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 60min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Try to reduce the
> number and/or duration of your walking breaks if you’re still using them -
> recommended if they’re helping you prioritize your running form above speed
> for now - as you grow closer to steady runs with fewer breaks.

> sprints; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Shasta** Just a little on-the-bike strength workout this week and
> the same rules apply: high, steady watts throughout each 20-second effort,
> even if that requires trimming this workout to 5 or 6 anaerobic repeats during
> your recovery week.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals + Sprints (2050m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 10x25m S Drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 11x100m Easy-Moderate, RPE6 w/ 5s
> rest between intervals; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Base Run** 35min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. Keep your
> continuous stretches on the rise but don’t fall into the trap of finishing
> your runs with sloppy form due to stubborn resistance to those often
> necessary, 1-minute (or shorter) walking breaks - use ‘em if you need ‘em,
> especially during a recovery week.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Slide Mountain** Down at the lower end of the Sweet Spot range,
> these 3 efforts will tone things down enough to keep your endurance in check
> while still allowing for some recovery to take place.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run** 35min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. This one’s mostly
> about maintaining your training consistency, so if your fatigue over the first
> few weeks is having its way with you, trim down this run a bit or skip it
> completely.
> 
> _Friday_ **Mount Albert** Taking the edge off of last week’s version of this
> workout, do your best to log some aero time at slightly lower output levels
> this week.
> 
> _Friday_ **Swim Speed + Sprint Intervals (2050m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4;
> 10x25m BB drills w/ 10s rest between drills; 6x150m of 50m Build from, RPE4 to

> All-Out, RPE10 w/ 20s rest between sprints; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Brick Workout (Pioneer + 10min Transition Run)** One more go at
> this same very relevant, highly useful workout where you’ll warm, ride
> reasonably hard and very steady for 45 minutes before hopping off the bike and
> transitioning directly into a short, 10-minute run where you’ll further
> familiarize yourself with running right through that initial bout of rubbery
> legs.
> 
> _Saturday_ **30min Recovery Run** RPE2 with a couple of 20-second strides,
> a.k.a. controlled sprints, with 40 seconds of easy running in between them
> performed somewhere near the middle of this run. Think of these as brief
> reminders of how to run fast, even with somewhat tired legs.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Continuous Base Swim (2000m)** Warm-Up 400m Easy, RPE4; 1200m Easy-
> Moderate, RPE6; Cool-Down 400m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Sunday_ **Base Run** 45min at Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6, still working toward
> a non-stop run as long as your form remains fully intact over the entire
> course of your run. If not, walk briefly and rekindle your form for another
> steady stretch of running.

> RPE4.
> 
> _Tuesday_ **Berryessa** This week steps the strength requirement back down a

> sprint (Fuji) or two (Mount Tai), do so wisely.
> 
> _Wednesday_ **Swim Base Intervals (2350m)** Warm-Up 350m Easy, RPE4; 10x25m FS

> RPE4, roughly 45 minutes in total.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Shortoff -1** Time for a little more of the rough stuff, even
> during base, to help you develop some high-end power as you target both leg
> speed and leg strength for 2 intense minutes at a time. Think of VO2max work
> as pulling your power up from the top while the later Sweet Spot workouts push
> your endurance up from the bottom. And if 2-minute repeats at 120% aren’t
> happening, try them at 110 or 115% and see how things go. In any case, keep
> pedaling quickly and fluidly for 2 solid minutes at a time and leave almost
> nothing in the tank by the end of each effort.
> 
> _Thursday_ **Base Run + Speed Intervals** Run 40min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> randomly insert 6x30s bursts of high speed, RPE9 over the course of the run
> with at least 1 minute of normal running between bursts.
> 
> _Friday_ **Tray Mountain** How’s a little 3x20 Sweet Spot workout sound for
> your midweek ride? How’s spending at least half of each interval in your aero
> position sound? How’s 20 minutes of continuous pedaling, 3 times in a row
> sound? It all sounds great if eventually smashing a 40k bike leg and setting a
> new PR in the process is on your agenda. Get to it.
>

> between sprints; 10x25m SK drills w/15s rest between drills; Cool-Down 350m
> easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Boarstone** Steady mileage at a highly aerobic work rate is the
> name of the game. Use these unrelenting, long stretches of time to pack some
> fatigue into your slow-twitch fibers and grow their capabilities as a result.
> By lifting your aerobic capacity, you’ll become capable of working at higher
> percentages of your FTP while relying on less glycogen in the process - last
> longer, go faster, burn less sugar.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Base Run + Flat Strides** Run for 35min Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and
> conclude your run with 6x20s controlled sprints, RPE10, on level ground w/ 40s
> of recovery between them. Open things up a bit, but practice the best form
> you’re capable of.

> _Sunday_ **Long Base Run** Run for 65min at an Easy-Moderate pace, RPE6. The
> goal here is steady, continuous mileage and a slower form of fatigue than
> you’ll see during your shorter base runs. Accordingly, reduce the intensity to
> 4 or 5RPE if it keeps your legs turning over, non-stop and injury-free.

> drills; Cool-Down 350m easy, RPE4.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Big Squaw** Steady mileage at a highly aerobic work rate is once
> again the objective and steady hours of unrelenting, seemingly unending muscle

> backpedal-breaks you might need to 10 seconds each.
> 
> _Saturday_ **Base Run + Flat Strides** Just like last Saturday, run for 35min
> Easy-Moderate, RPE6 and conclude your run with 6x20s controlled sprints,
